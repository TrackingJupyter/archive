Tracking Jupyter Newsletter, the Twelfth...
===========================================

by Tony Hirst

Welcome to this  twelfth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ12).  
  
Times been tight over the last couple of weeks (or at least, spent on other things), so this round-up isn't much more than a quick scan of my feeds...  
 

News
----

Just missing the cut by minutes for the last issue, the [latest release](https://pandoc.org/releases.html) of Pandoc (v. 2.6) provides support for the Jupyter notebook _ipynb_ format as both an input and an output format. Conversions have typically been mediated by [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) up to now, so gaining first class support within pandoc could make for some interesting workflows. _\[How does the pandoc produced .md compare to the markdown used in something like Jupytext, I wonder...? And how does it compare to Rmd?  —Ed.\]_  
  
Portable Apps have just released their 1.2 version of [Jupyter Portable](https://www.portabledevapps.net/jupyter-portable.php), their portable version of Jupyter Lab for Windows.  
  
The JupyterHub Helm Chart for Kubernetes made it to its [beta version of v0.8](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/z2jh-helm-chart-v0-8-beta-is-out/392) last week...  
  
A [proposal to remove XML support from _nbformat_](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jupyter/FMkYgTC-80I) has also been posted... Who knew it was there, even?!  
 

On the Horizon?
---------------

I missed this announcement from **CoCalc**, a collaborative learning environment for code,  last year, but it's the sort of thing I can see working its way into JupyterLab: an **X11 desktop view** that lets you use Linux desktop apps in a browser window: [CoCalc brings collaborative persistent graphical Linux applications to your browser, with integrated clipboard and HiDPI support](http://blog.sagemath.com/cocalc/2018/11/05/x11.html). One example they give is running VS Code, via a browser, in the CoCalc environment... Another thing to note, a [CoCalc Docker image](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-docker) is available, so you can [run your own free CoCalc Docker Server on Google Cloud Platform](http://blog.sagemath.com/cocalc/2018/11/07/cocalc-docker-gcp.html).  
 

Reference Deployments
---------------------

I spotted this Jupyterhub reference deployment mentioned at IBM's Think 2019 conference: [IzODA/jupyterhub](https://github.com/IzODA/jupyterhub). Features include: _deployment on a single host; DockerSpawner spawns single-user nb2kg Jupyter Notebook servers in separate Docker containers; persistentJupyterhub data and user notebook directories in Docker volumes; LDAPAuthenticator._  
  
Setting up SSL with Let's Encrypt is something else I've yet to try: here's a [quick recipe](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-server/) for doing just that.  
 

Team Environments
-----------------

In #TJ11 I mentioned a recipe for uploading notebooks, in bulk, to _nbgallery_; one advantage of that is that _nbgallery_ provides a handy notebook search engine. Searching across multiple notebooks in general is still an open issue, I think, so here's another take: [find your Jupyter notebooks with **ElasticSearch**](https://blog.quiltdata.com/find-your-jupyter-notebooks-with-elasticsearch-1fe300c1cd0f). It's part of the [T4 team data hub for S3](https://github.com/quiltdata/t4) (alpha), but it would be good to see it as a standalone service, perhaps one that could run in a separate container sharing a volume with a notebook server notebooks directory/volume.  
 

User Environments
-----------------

I've mentioned announcements of Jupyter integration with Microsoft **VS Code** in previous issues, and there seem to be new announcements each month (like this one for [IPython Console support in VS Code](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2019/01/29/python-in-visual-studio-code-january-2019-release/)), but hadn't at the time really grokked what VS Code is/was (a cross-platform electron app code editor). So I had a go at firing it up and connecting it to a Jupyter server — [Connecting to a Remote Jupyter Notebook Server Running on Digital Ocean from Microsoft VS Code](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/11/connecting-to-a-remote-jupyter-notebook-server-running-on-digital-ocean-from-microsoft-vs-code/) — though I've still yet to try it out...  
  
The NII [multi-outputs notebook extension](https://github.com/NII-cloud-operation/Jupyter-multi_outputs) allows code cell outputs to be saved into cell relative output tabs and then compared with the current output ([quick review](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/11/quick-review-jupyter-multi-outputs-notebook-extension/)) but the [nteract/scrapbook](https://github.com/nteract/scrapbook) extension seems to take this a step further. In particular, it allows you to save _scraps_ (_"serializable data values such as strings, lists of objects, pandas dataframes, or data table references"_) and _snaps_ (_"named displays of information such as a generated image, plot, or UI message which encapsulate information but do not store the underlying data"_) into notebook metadata for later use. (Scraps can also be loaded into other notebooks by importing the annotated notebook and extracting scraps/snaps from it.) _\[From an educational / pedagogical perspective, there is still a lot to do in terms of working out quite how features like this can be used most effectively to support teaching and learning. —Ed.\]_  
  
Creative use of notebook metadata elements is still underexplored, I think. This [crude example](https://habr.com/en/post/439570/) of cell magic to create tags for code cells makes me wonder: how might we be able to make use of cell tags? _\[It shouldn't take much to properly package that code into an extension, methinks... —Ed.\]_  
  
One of the issues in the _nteract_ repo for a long time has been for an IPython kernel to be bundled inside the app, rather than requiring users to connect to a preinstalled kernel. An alpha version of the[ phildini/hera](https://github.com/phildini/hera) app for Mac OS/X does come with a kernel as part of the app. _\[It doesn't look very fully featured at the moment, though... —Ed.\]_  
  
If you're happy running experimental warez, and are happy with iOS development, then from the tweets I've been following, [holzschu/Carnets](https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets), a standalone notebook serving iOS app, might provide you with some app building entertainment for the weekend.  
  
_\[Alternatively, if you fancy trying to get some standalone apps running in MyBinder, either headless or notebook proxied, I posted a round-up of [several ways of running OpenRefine in MyBinder](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/10/openrefine-running-in-mybinder-several-ways/) a few days ago... —Ed.\]_  
 

Example Notebooks and Extensions
--------------------------------

  
Ever fancied building a **recommender system**? Microsoft have just released a set of notebooks that walk you though just how to do that: [Microsoft/Recommenders](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders). Separate notebooks cover _data preparation_, _modeling_ (review of different recommender algorithms), _evaluation_ (_"evaluate recommender algorithms for different ranking and rating metrics"_), _model selection and optimisation_ (_"how to fine tune hyperparameters for recommender algorithms"_) and _operationalisation_ (_"how to deploy models in production systems"_).  
  
The devops folk have perhaps still to get into the "literate" style of readable narratives in Jupyter notebooks, but I'm seeing more examples of scripts appearing in notebooks. Like this walk through — [conversant/docker-swarm-local](https://github.com/conversant/docker-swarm-local) —  of how to _"initialize \[a Docker\] swarm ..., deploy stacks for Docker Registry, Traefik and more, push images to our private registry, and spin up a couple more nodes and register those with our swarm"_.  
  
Linking notebook servers to application servers running in their own Docker containers is a very powerful model, I think. Here's an example of it in action, connecting a notebook server to Gnucap, the Gnu Circuit Analysis Package, to bring a biot of SPICE into your notebook life: [mulderp/gnucap-jupyter](https://github.com/mulderp/gnucap-jupyter). And if you fancy controlling your Docker containers from a control panel in a notebook environment, this could be handy: [BioDepot/nbdocker](https://github.com/BioDepot/nbdocker/tree/master/nbdocker).

A special section on graph visualisation _\[that is, graph as in network, not graph as in chart... —Ed.\]_ has been on my to do list for ages. But rather than add to the backlogged items for such a section, here's d3 force directed graph plotting extension, [intuitivetextmining/d3fdgraph](http://github.com/intuitivetextmining/d3fdgraph), to get started with... There's also a [great tutorial on how it was put together](https://intuitivetextmining.blogspot.com/2019/02/force-directed-graphs-in-jupyter.html)...  
  
And if you have interactive d3js code you'd like to use to render a static SVG image, try this: [jbn/d3nb](https://github.com/jbn/d3nb).  
  
Top tips... and things you may have forgotten about...:

*   some [handy recipes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38783027/jupyter-notebook-display-two-pandas-tables-side-by-side) for displaying two _pandas_ dataframes side by side in a Jupyter notebook;
*   in a code cell, I never forget than _?myfunction_ displays help for a particular function, but keep forgetting the _??myfunction_ displays the function code...
