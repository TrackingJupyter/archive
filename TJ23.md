Welcome to this twenty-third edition of the Tracking Jupyter newsletter (#TJ23).

_Last time I posted, it was still summer, and I'd started to collate some playful things to idle away the lazy days with... But now it's well into Autumn — the Forest of Dean was replete in her red and golden finery when I marshalled on the Wyedean rally over the weekend — and there's a probably huge backlog of stuff to consider. I had intended to refactor the way the newsletter works, but there are only so many hours in the day, so it's back to the eclectic mix-style although perhaps with a bit more commentary, because that's just how it's gonna be..._

News Highlights
---------------

**Jupyter notebook** has bumped up to [v6.0.2](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#release-6-0-2); **JupyterLab** is out at the [v1.2.\*](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/changelog.html#v1-2-0) level, and [2.0 alpha](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/whats-new-in-jupyterlab-2-0/2187) is also out, with the full 2.0 release _"targeted for January 2020"_. _\[I still prefer: a) notebook environments; b) VS Code as an IDE... Mutter, mutter, grumble, grumble... —Ed.\]_  
  
Showing that notebook interfaces are increasingly _a thing_, **Netflix** announced **[Polynote](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447)**, which in some respects might be considered as a next generation notebook environment compared to the current Jupyter notebook. WYSIWYG editing, polyglot code cells, and linear control flow, as well as a built in variable inspector and _\[limited..? —Ed.\]_ _.ipynb_ support all featured in the initial public release _\[my first impressions review can be found [here](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/10/24/news-arise-all-ye-notebooks/)...—Ed.\]_  
  
By way of contrast, Adobe have also been [talking up](https://medium.com/adobetech/reimagining-jupyter-notebooks-for-enterprise-scale-8bc6340d504a) their JupyterLab usage on the Adobe Experience Platform, but not, from what I can tell, sharing any code back to the wider community? One of the things the write-up mentions is their _"developed a resource usage plug-in to provide RAM, CPU, and disk space usage indicators"__\[sounds a bit like [nbresuse](https://github.com/yuvipanda/nbresuse), which I think was looking for a new maintainer? —Ed.\]_; another is their parameterised notebooks _\[erm, like Netflix's contributed [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill)? —Ed.\]_. Any lack of open sharing means I'll similarly not share such related news on in future.  
  
Over in JupyterLab rival IDE land, Microsoft now offer [embedded native notebook editing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-support-for-native-editing-of-jupyter-notebooks-in-vs-code/) in their **VS Code** IDE via their October VS Code Python extension release \[[VS Code October release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-october-2019-release/)\]. Microsoft has also opened up "official" kernels for [.NET (C#, F#) code in Jupyter notebooks](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-with-juypter-notebooks-is-here-preview-1/) _\[notwithstanding that an alternative F# kernel has been [around for some time](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp)...—Ed.\]_; support for plotting in F# notebooks is via [XPlot](https://fslab.org/XPlot/). Over at Azure Data Studio, the [November release](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2019/11/05/the-november-2019-release-of-azure-data-studio-is-now-available/) adds support for PowerShell kernels, collapsible code cells... _and_ Jupyter Book...  
  
Similarly not quite Jupyter, and to my mind falling somewhere between Voila dashboards and R's Shiny dashboard scripting approach, **[Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/)** lets you write code in a .py file and render directly updated, executed, interactive scripts therefrom _\[a bit like Scripted Forms used to? I can also see this making it's way into VS Code. Thinks: you could probably author the .py in a notebook UI either directly, or via pairing, using Jupytext, then save it and render it via Streamlit?—Ed.\]_. On the other hand, if you fancy running RISE slideshows as a standalone application, the new [Voilà reveal template](https://blog.jupyter.org/a-slideshow-template-for-voil%C3%A0-apps-435f67d10b4f) can be used to publish it for you.  
  
From the folk who run [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/), [manuscripts.io](https://www.manuscripts.io/about/) \[[announcement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540955/)\] looks like it's trying to offer a rich, word processor style environment for authoring computational research papers  _\[cf. NextJournal \[[#TJ15](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ15.md#showcasing)\], perhaps? —Ed.\]_, for which a wide range of academic publishing templates are supported. Figures can be created reproducibly from code fragments written in Julia, Python or R and executed on a Jupyter powered backend kernel.  
  
There's a new **_Deploy to Azure_** button for _The Littlest Jupyterhub (TLJH)_, [TLJH-Azure-Button](https://github.com/trallard/TLJH-azure-button). This sits alongside the [Binderhub — Deploy to Azure](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/binderhub-deploy) button in simplifying the set-up requirements for Azure deployments in the form of templated forms for customising minimum viable deployment set-up requirements.  
  
If you're looking for **free access to GPUs** and don't fancy locking into to Google's Colab, **Paperspace** have [announced](https://blog.paperspace.com/paperspace-launches-gradient-community-notebooks/) their [Gradient Community Notebooks](https://gradient.paperspace.com/free-gpu) service. The service seems to provide access to C3 CPU and  NVIDIA M4000 or NVIDIA P5000 GPU instances and includes 5GB of persistent storage, with runtime sessions lasting up to 6 hours at a time. Meanwhile, **[deepnote](https://www.deepnote.com/)** (_"data science for teams"_) seems to be pitching itself as a rival to Colab in terms of its product offering: Jupyter notebook, realtime collaboration, versioning, code review. _\[It's also still in request-access mode at the moment... —Ed.\]_  
  
If you're a **Code Anywhere** user, here's a [recipe](https://www.gatyagumilang.com/install-jupyter-notebook-codeanywhere/) for getting a notebook server up and running in a container on that environment and finding the notebook server port.  
  
IRuby user and looking for charting support? [iruby-chartkick](https://github.com/Absolventa/iruby-chartkick) might help...  
  
Previously mentioned as a news item in [#TJ19](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ19.md#news), work on CERN's GSoC 2019**[Jupyter-Package-Manager](https://github.com/techtocore/Jupyter-Package-Manager)** appears to be continuing, whilst there seems to be another candidate JupyterLab package manager _\[pip only atm? —Ed.\]_ in the form of [jupytercalpoly/jupyterlab-pkginstaller](https://github.com/jupytercalpoly/jupyterlab-pkginstaller).  
  
**plotly**, publishers of the charting package that works _really well_ in notebooks, recently [announced](https://twitter.com/EGouillart/status/1186391586646691840) they'd added MyBinder links to their tutorials \[[example](https://plot.ly/python/bubble-charts/), _top right..._\]. _\[+1 for making interactive / runnable examples, but I do wonder about who's paying for the servers...? Can we, should we, expect to see a plotly node in the Binderhub federation? —Ed.\]_  
  
For **enterprisey dashboards**, the early alpha **[MavenWorks](https://github.com/Mavenomics/MavenWorks)** seems to promise drag and drop goodness for wiring up custom dashboards, whilst Voilà continues its journey updating and replacing the original _jupyter-dashboards_ initiative, most recently with the release of [Voilà gridstack templates](https://blog.jupyter.org/voila-gridstack-template-8a431c2b353e) _\[the post also notes support for legacy jupyter-dashboard notebooks... —Ed.\]_.  
  
I've not had much luck getting the [nbnovnc](https://github.com/ryanlovett/nbnovnc) extension working on MyBinder, but I have come across a couple of examples recently that _do_ demonstrate how to proxy GUI based apps running on a virtual desktop using **noVNC** in MyBinder: [manics/jupyter-omeroanalysis-desktop](https://github.com/manics/jupyter-omeroanalysis-desktop) and thence[guiwitz/napari\_demo](https://github.com/guiwitz/napari_demo/). The utility of this is that you can use MyBinder to make desktop applications on-demand available (although they may be clunky to run). Yuvi Panda seemed to spot it too, and derived a bare bones [jupyter-desktop](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyter-desktop) package for quick-starting your own Jupyter server proxied desktop environments. _\[Jupyter proxied noVNC means it should be possible to use JupyterLab to publish authenticated access to virtualised desktop applications. I did have an OpenGL driver issue trying to run the VREP simulator though... A missing dependency, or are the MyBinder servers not up to it? —Ed.\]_  
  
Visualising notebooks in a notebook has always been a pain, but the rather wonderful **[netwulf](https://netwulf.readthedocs.io/en/latest)** application provides an interactive UI for styling **_networkx_** networks _\[think: Gephi in the browser, sort of... —Ed.\]_. The styling app runs on its own server, so it'd be nice to see this exposed via jupyter-server-proxy, or even made available as a Jupyter server extension in its own right.  
  
Display of **gene networ****ks** is also supported by the [simonsfoundation/jp\_gene\_viz](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz) package. It includes the[dNetwork NetworkDisplay widget](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz/blob/master/doc/dNetwork%20widget%20overview.ipynb) that provides a range of tools for filtering and displaying a network; combined [dual network displays](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz/blob/master/doc/Combined%20widgets.ipynb) are also supported. For displaying [PySB](http://pysb.org/), [Tellurium](http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/), [BNGL](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/Faeder/?page_id=409), [SBML](http://sbml.org/Main_Page), and [Ecell4](https://github.com/ecell/ecell4) models using [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) as dynamic and static network visualizations via a Jupyter widget, [PyViPR](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/pyvipr) may provide what you need. _\[The docs claim it can also be used to "visualize networks encoded in the graphml, sif, sbgn xml, cytoscape json, gexf, gml and yaml formats", but I haven't tried that yet...—Ed.\]_  
  
Notebooks have structure, but command line search tools, such as grep, don't necessarily exploit that structure. So the [nbcommands](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/nbcommands) commandline tools (_nbtouch_, _nbgrep_, _nbhead_, _nbtail_ and _nbcat_, thus far...) could be handy...  
  
Faced with a question of putting together training sets for automated code generation models, where would _you_ look? This arXiv preprint on _JuICe: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Dataset for Open Domain Context-based Code Generation_ \[[arxiv:1910.02216](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02216) and [data/code](https://github.com/rajasagashe/juice)\] uses a corpus of Jupyter notebooks pulled from Github, _"observe that the presence of NL \[natural language\] markdown is correlated with notebook quality and remov\[ing\] any notebooks that have more than three times the number of code cells as the number of NL cells"_. _\[Have they seen my code?! —Ed.\]_ As a smaller, higher quality, dataset, the researchers also sampled _nbgrader_ notebooks, using correct code solutions to the same tasks to provide high quality _\[at least in terms of functional correctness? —Ed.\]_ training examples.  
  
And finally, if you fancy listening in on, or participating in, Jupyter project team and **community meetings**, there's now a [centralised calendar](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html) for checking on the dates... There's also a call out for proposals to the Bloomberg and AWS supported third round of J[upyter Community Workshops](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshops-call-for-proposals-for-jan-aug-2020-710f687e30f4), to run January-August, 2020. If you fancy communicating such news to your JupyterHub users, this [JupyterHub announcement service](https://github.com/rcthomas/jupyterhub-announcement) lets you publish news announcements on the path _/services/announcement/_.

HPC and Enterprise Updates
--------------------------

**Jupyter Enterprise Gateway** came out at [v2.0](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-enterprise-gateway-2-0-is-now-available/2053), including support for Docker and Docker Swarm configurations, Spark 2.4 in Kubernetes and Dask on YARN _\[I have no real understanding of what any of that means...—Ed.\]_. Python, Scala and R kernels are all supported, Python with Tensorflow and GPU support if you need it. Support for Python 2 has also gone...  
  
In passing, I note this "official" set of documented [JupyterHub deployment in HPC settings](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-hpc) examples; this [jupyterlab-slurm](https://github.com/NERSC/jupyterlab-slurm)[ extension](https://github.com/NERSC/jupyterlab-slurm) that _"interfaces with the Slurm Workload Manager \[to\] provid\[e\] simple and intuitive controls for viewing and managing jobs on the queue"_ may also be of interest to the HPC folk. Elsewhere, the [cybergis/Jupyter-xsede](https://github.com/cybergis/Jupyter-xsede) repo provides a _"production configuration for submitting HPC jobs from Jupyter notebooks"_ using Comet as the target HPC platform.  
  
If you need to integrate with **FPGAs**, InAccel has [announced](https://insidehpc.com/2019/11/accelerate-big-data-and-hpc-applications-with-fpgas-using-jupyter-hub/) the integration of JupyterHub as a front end to their FPGA resource manager _"that allows the instant deployment, scaling and virtualization of FPGA clusters"_.  
  
For those waiting on a long-running job to finish and looking for something to read, the following preprints may be of interest to folk working in the area: [Jupyter as Common Technology Platform for Interactive HPC Services](http://https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09929) \[_arXiv:1807.09929_\] from the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute describes the use of Jupyterhub as _"a general-purpose point-of-entry to interactive high performance computing services"_, reviewing _"advantages for research and instructional uses, and lessons learned"_. _\[This paper references the earlier "Portable learning environments for hands-on computational instruction: Using container- and cloud-based technology to teach data science" \[[arXiv/1703.04900](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04900)__ (early 2017) which may be of interest to edu-minded readers...—Ed.\]_  
  
If you're working in the area of high energy physics, _Machine Learning Pipelines with Modern Big Data Tools for High Energy Physics_ [\[arXiv/1909.10389](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10389)\] describes an example pipeline for working with research datasets within that context.  
  
And finally, when it comes to discovering datasets and data related workflows across a large corpus of notebooks, _Juneau: data lake management for Jupyter_, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment VLDB Endowment,  12:12, August 2019 \[[PDF](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p1902-zhang.pdf); _not_ the Apache project of the same name...\] looks like it takes an interesting approach, indexing data source references (data files loaded in via code cells) and tables produced by code cells in order to support discovery of related datasets and workflows across multiple notebooks. _\[Or maybe it's not interesting...no code I could find to play with... so maybe just another bit of unreproducible academic yawn...?—Ed.\]_

Taking a Wider View
-------------------

Whilst Jupyter notebooks are still arguably leading the way in the terms of notebook adoption, some interesting alternatives or complements have also appeared recently that address some of the issues associated with working with notebook environments _\[for a recent discussion raising typical concerns, see the blog post, [The notebook anti-pattern](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-notebook-anti-pattern-b1b55910929e)\]_.  
  
Most recently, heavy adopters of Jupyter Notebooks, **Netflix**, who already support parallel projects such as the _nteract_ desktop application and data explorer, and _papermill_ automation tool, have just [announced](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447) their own aforementioned_\[see the news announcement above...—Ed.\]_open-source polyglot notebook environment, **[polynote](https://polynote.org/)** \[[repo](https://github.com/polynote/polynote)\] _\[only tested on Linux and Mac's, thus far... —Ed.\]_. With a JVM backend offering Scala, Python and SQL (for starters) there's also Spark support for running larger data jobs, and Vega cells for embedding (and displaying) Vega scripted charts. For editing text cells, there's a WYSiWYG, rather than raw markdown, editor _\[I also note the new_ _[jupytercalpoly/jupyterlab-richtext-mode](https://github.com/jupytercalpoly/jupyterlab-richtext-mode) extension, which tries to do the same for JupyterLab...—Ed.__\]_. Polynote also addresses some frequent quibbles raised against vanilla Jupyter notebooks: code completion and a variable inspector embed desirable _\[allegedly...—Ed.\]_ IDE like features, and a linear execution model (similar to the Jupyter [nodebook](https://github.com/stitchfix/nodebook) extension) that enforces cell execution order. Executing cells are highlighted _\[think something like the Jupyter [multi-outputs extension](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/11/quick-review-jupyter-multi-outputs-notebook-extension/)...—Ed.\]_ and stack trace / error messages propagated up from the underlying JVM _\[which I suspect  means you sometimes get a Java error? —Ed.\]_. The filetype appears to be _.ipynb_, but your mileage may vary when trying to import pre-existing notebooks depending on how ornamented your notebooks are with metadata and code cell outputs.

_\[Thinks... it would be interesting to see how far a Jupyter notebook installation with a carefully curated set of magics and extensions could replicate the Polynote experience... —Ed.\]_

Drawing in Notebooks
--------------------

In [#TJ17](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ17.md#training-data-annotation-tagging-extensions), I mentioned several widgets for interactively annotating or tagging datasets, including the ability to highlight and tag particular areas of an image. This sort of task involves a handful of steps: firstly, retrieving the object to be tagged and rendering it; secondly, providing a means to highlight particular areas of the rendered object and tag them; thirdly, saving the highlighted area and tag information in a way that associates it with the tagged object.  
  
I don't recall if the annotation extensions built on top of reusable widgets for identifying, and perhaps even cropping, particular areas of an image, but this attempt at a [jupyter-interactive-cropping-widget](https://github.com/samjett247/jupyter-interactive-cropping-widget) that appeared just before the summer looked like it aspired to providing that sort of functionality. _\[Again, still early days, with some core Python packages listed in the requirements that break thinks if you try to run it in MyBinder. I couldn't actually get hold of the cropped bit of an image either? One to check back on in a month or two, maybe... Which is now. And it doesn't look to have moved on any...—Ed.\]_  
  
In [#TJ21](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ21.md#drawing-on-notebooks), I reviewed several extensions that let you scribble over notebooks, as well as looking at some of the plumbing that supports widget'n'kernel comms. So picking up on both of those, here's another extension for freehand drawing on a notebook embedded canvas: [nicknytko/notebook-drawing](https://github.com/nicknytko/notebook-drawing). Slightly more advanced is the [uclmr/egal](https://github.com/uclmr/egal) extension which supports a range of shape creation tools (circles, rectangles, etc., as well as straight lines, arrows, freehand lines and text) as well as frame based animation. _\[This reminds me of my own attempt from some time ago at a [Simple IPython magic for working with HTML / Javascript Canvas](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/ipython_magic_canvas)... Which was nowhere near as sophisticated as the egal editor, but, you know, I was reminded of it... Erm...—Ed.\]_  
  
A range of other extensions support the creation of **SVG** graphics. For example, [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) can be embedded within a JupyterLab panel using the [jupyterlab-drawio](https://github.com/QuantStack/jupyterlab-drawio) extension, although any SVG diagrams you do create there need to be saved to disk and then loaded back in to a Jupyter enviroment if you want to access them or present them more directly.  
  
For scripting over an **HTML canvas**,[jp\_svg\_canvas](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_svg_canvas) provides a simple API for writing to a notebook embedded canvas as well as receiving mouse events from it. More comprehensive is the [_ipycanvas_](https://blog.jupyter.org/ipycanvas-a-python-canvas-for-jupyter-bbb51e4777f7) extension _"exposes the Canvas API to IPython"_ \[[code](https://github.com/martinRenou/ipycanvas)\]. The announcement post suggests that hooking in the [ipyevents](https://github.com/mwcraig/ipyevents) extension, a _"custom widget for returning mouse and keyboard events to Python"_, should make callbacks from the canvas possible _\[although I didn't spot a demo of that? —Ed.\]_.  
  
As if that wasn't enough,[jp\_doodle](https://github.com/AaronWatters/jp_doodle) seems even more adventurous, _"mak\[ing\] implementing special purpose interactive visualizations easy"_ _\[allegedly...—Ed.\] _via the JQuery _dual canvas_ component. The blurb suggests the package _"is designed to facilitate the development of bespoke scientific data presentation and interactive exploration tools"_, and it certainly looks like this is one to consider when it comes to scripted authoring of vector graphics. Interested? Watch more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyuCqlTvf0c), have a play via the binderised repo, and check out [this tutorial](https://github.com/AaronWatters/jp_doodle/blob/master/notebooks/workshop/0%20-%20Outline.ipynb).  
  
And finally, one thing many of the newer widgets show is communication of state and events back from the canvas into the code environment _\[as noted in [#TJ21](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ21.md#jupyter-plumbing-andwiring)... —Ed.\]_. Which makes me think: a [wiris](https://docs.wiris.com/en/mathtype/mathtype_web/sdk-api/embedding#hand) widget could be interesting if it could pass back _MathML_ or _sympy_ code to the python context from hand-drawn equations inside a notebook?
