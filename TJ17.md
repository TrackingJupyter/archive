Tracking Jupyter Newsletter, the Seventeenth...
===============================================

by Tony Hirst

Welcome to this seventeenth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ17). A lot of people claim seventeen as their lucky number, so are you feeling lucky today..?  
  
In the Cambrian-style explosion of creativity afforded by the Jupyter ecosystem, I've started wondering if we're in a position yet to spot lines that are likely to be evolutionarily successful rather than just being hopeful monsters. And where a niche has been identified by several competitors, are any fittest survivors starting to emerge? _\[Answer: possibly... erm...—Ed.\]_  
 

Errata
------

It seems like I messed up a link in #TJ16 to Jupyter notebooks running on _glitch_, so here's a [corrected one](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/jupyter-on-glitch). _\[glitch... doh! —Ed.\]_ Eagle eyed readers may have spotted what the error was and fixed the link manually, but sorry about that... I will work on a link checker when I get a chance _\[TinyLetter is a barebones service that doesn't offer such things as far as I know... —Ed.\]_  
 

News
----

**JupyterHub** is [now out](https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-jupyterhub-1-0-8fff78acad7f) officially out at the 1.0 version level, with a named server UI, auth refreshing/expiry and support for [internal SSL](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/websecurity.html#encrypt-internal-connections-with-ssl-tls) \[[release notes](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html)\]. _\[Is one of the S's for "spaghetti"? Hosting securely, at scale, never ceases to confuse me. E.g. does this — [Dynamic SSL Proxy For Jupyter Notebook How to forward traffic to a dynamic target destination](https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/dynamic-ssl-proxy-for-jupyter-notebook-595cb97c1db2) — make sense or not?! And is there a better way? —Ed.\]_  
  
**repo2docker** is also up to v. [0.9.0](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#version-0-9-0), with improved support for Julia environment building; config files can now be placed in _.binder_ as well as _binder/_ directories. The _conda_ environment has been updated to 4.6.14 too...  
  
What's more, **Binderhub**, the service in part powered by _repo2docker_, is now [out of beta](https://blog.jupyter.org/binderhub-is-out-of-beta-fa2781a229d6). In passing, the MyBinder team also provided this handy [insight](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/pycon-2019-and-mybinder-org/920) into the sort of resource typically available from MyBinder when they were trying to gauge likely usage from PyCon. For example, _"there is a 100 live instances per repo limit in place, once you reach it new users will get a “sorry we are full” message"_. Furthermore, _"every 70 (or so) additional live instances \[require a\] need to scale up \[the\] cluster which takes about 10 minutes. If the cluster is at 400 live instances in total right now, then at 471 we will need to scale the cluster up. During scale up everyone has to join the waiting queue."_  
  
Notebook slideshow runner **RISE** is out at v. [5.5.0](http://damianavila.github.io/blog/posts/rise-550-is-out.html) with improved docs, installation and some new shortcut keys.  
  
Graphics package **Vega-Lite** bumped up to 3.0 a few weeks ago, and now stands at [3.2.1](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/). It's well supported in notebooks by [ipyvega](https://github.com/vega/ipyvega).  
  
Mappers ArcGIS have been promoting their **ArcGIS Pro** API access from notebooks a [bit more](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/api-python/administration/python-api-core-concepts-part-2/), recommending that _"Jupyter Notebook is the recommended IDE for working with the ArcGIS API for Python"_.  
  
**OpenCV** are [starting](https://opencv.org/courses) a Kickstarter campaign to fund a series of notebook based courses on using OpenCV.  _\[Thinks... Am I going to have to start running regular searches for Jupyter / JupyterHub / JupyterLab / BinderHub on crowd funding platforms?! —Ed.\]_  
  
Presumably in an attempt to keep up with the (free) Carnets iOS application (standalone/self-contained notebook app, [now](https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets/issues/7) in v.1.2 with added _pandas_), the commercial [Juno iOS client](https://navoshta.com/juno/) now also embeds its own standalone Jupyter server in a free version of the app, with access to arbitrary notebook servers still available in the paid for version. _\[Juno's everywhere... there's also a [Juno macOS app](https://github.com/uetchy/juno) that provides a __minimal notebook server accessed via the macOS menubar... —Ed.__\] _  
  
Polish firm Wasat _\[provider of "stellar quality services" and a logo reminiscent of, oh, I dunno, something... Thinks: trademarks are one of the few things that it makes sense to defend...—Ed.\]_ have [launched](https://eomag.eu/wasat-launched-jupyteo-com-service/) a new Jupyter fronted cloud based IDE for processing and mapping **Earth Observation data**: [Jupyteo](https://www.jupyteo.com/).  
  
What happens if you cross the ability to save code output snippets into metadata (as in the _Multi Outputs Notebook Extension_ (#TJ12)) with something like CoCalc's _TimeTravel_ ability (#TJ16)? Something like Microsoft's new [nbgather](https://github.com/microsoft/gather) JupyerLab extension maybe?The extension appears to allow you to "gather"  the contents of a code cell and it's output after you have run it and thenceforth navigate the **code cell execution history** of gathered code cells. You can also "gather" a set of set of selected code cells in the clipboard or to a new notebook. Markdown cells don't look to be handled, nor could I obviously tell which cells I'd gathered. But it is still very alpha. _\[And I do find JupyterLab overwhelming in its options. menus, layout, and general clutter, and very confusing to work with... Devs go for Eclipse, I go for simpler things...—Ed.\]_  
  
Microsoft have also been at work looking for ways of supporting the training of interpretable models and explaining blackbox systems. [InterpretML](https://github.com/Microsoft/interpret), another alpha release, provides a rich graphical dashboard, embedded in a notebook, for exploring models. Demo notebooks include interpretable models and blackbox interpretability for binary classification and regression.  
  
And if that's not enough, a month or so ago [saw](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2019/03/27/quantum-development-kit-update-brings-q-to-jupyter-notebooks/) a Quantum Development Kit Update bring Q# to Jupyter Notebooks. Since then, Microsoft have released some related puzzle time activities: [Solve the Quantum Katas Online with Jupyter Notebooks](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/solve-quantum-katas-online-with-jupyter-notebooks/) _\[I note that the links are to repos run via MyBinder, not Azure Notebooks, and not a Binderhub run on Azure on Microsoft's dollar. Just sayin'...—Ed.\]_  
  
_\[Also of note, the [latest release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/) of the Windows Subsystem for Linux, WSL 2 looks like it does Linux properly... —Ed.\]_  
  
Data analysis tool [Graphistry hits v.2.0](https://www.graphistry.com/blog/experiencing-the-future-of-gpu-analytics-using-nvidia-rapids-and-graphistry-0). Two things to note: first, what's the easiest way to try out the tool? _"We've been a mission on helping users achieve the fastest possible 'time to graph insight': Jupyter notebooks pre-installed with sample cookbooks make it easy to try out many data sources"_. Second, where can you try it? _"Get started with secure one-click launch in AWS. By running in your team's AWS account, you can guarantee your data stays private"_ for _$10 / hour\* + EC2 GPU fees_ and the ability to _"schedule free assisted setup!"_ _\[their !, not mine...—Ed!\]_  
  
More [digestible details](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/) have surfaced about the rationale for, and implementation of,_** Pyodide,**_ Mozilla's recipe for implementing a full scientific Python stack in the browser. Some of the[original reports](http://www.nexedi.com/news/erp5-Migrate.Jupyter.Notebook.Iodide) around Iodide notebooks suggested the ability to import Jupyter _.ipynb_ format notebooks, but related documentation and the demo service seems to have disappeared since._ \[I wonder if small pieces loosely joined might provide a workaround solution to this? For example, if Jupytext moves to support conversion of ipynb to the J[SMD (](http://iodide-project.github.io/docs/jsmd/)[JavaScript MarkDown](http://iodide-project.github.io/docs/jsmd/)[) format](http://iodide-project.github.io/docs/jsmd/), the file format that Iodide notebooks are written in?—Ed.\]_  
  
From the Turing Institute, their [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/) _"lightly __opinionated guide to reproducible data science"_ is now available via a Jupyter Book publishing route. _\[Everything is "opinionated" nowadays. WTF does 'opinionated' mean in tech contexts anyway? Un-peer-reviewed? Personal opinion? Biased? Convenient / pragmatic / probably a bit wrong but it seems to work..?! —Ed.\]_  
  
And finally, the not-quite a full package / extension recipe for [templating notebooks](https://towardsdatascience.com/set-your-jupyter-notebook-up-right-with-this-extension-24921838a332), as mentioned in #TJ13, still isn't, but here's a post nudging the automation a step further forwards: [Create a template for your Jupyter Notebooks​](https://medium.com/@jhurley_97842/create-a-template-for-your-jupyter-notebooks-80352d265cd4). _\[This newsletter's about "tracking", right...?! —Ed.\]_  
 

Past and Future Events and Opportunities
----------------------------------------

_\[I find out about 'em late, and they're gone before the next edition is out... —Ed.\]_  
  
From the blurb for a Jupyter Notebook in Science and Education [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Jupyter-Meetup/events/261037105/) that _\[presumably...?—Ed.\]_ took place at UCSD on May 8th, a presentation on Data Science Support at the UC San Diego Library: _"like many campus-wide and departmental units at UC San Diego, the library has scaled up its data science capacity to better support \[data science\]. Traditional library services ... and guidelines for best practices (including for Jupyter notebooks!), and hands-on training have been expanded to meet the computationally-intensive needs of data science education and research"_. I used to rant at Librarians a lot about the need to support things like this.. _\[Thinks: hmm, what happened to the server I stole and gave to the Library to run a notebook service on...?!—Ed.\]_  
  
There's a Jupyter Community Workshop on [Jupyter Server Design and Roadmap](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshop-jupyter-server-design-and-roadmap-workshop-6e6760cc5098), May 16-17th at the IBM facility in Bois-Colombes, Paris.  
  
Upcoming online, May 28th sees the next [Jupyter Community Call](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/all-jupyter-community-calls/668), 9am PST.  
   
If you're in Perth at Curtin University on July 2nd-4th, [ResBaz](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/perth/) looks fun...  
  
Not strictly Jupyter related, but the Pew Research Center are [looking for](https://jobs-prc.icims.com/jobs/5923/computational-social-scientist/job) a computational social scientist...  
  
And for your viewing and listening pleasure this issue? From the [IBM Sponsored Jupyter track](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ca-2019/public/schedule/stopic/3087) at #StrataData, there's Chris Holdgraf's presentation on [Jupyter Book: Interactive books running in the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ603ZQQAuQ) (video), while for the audiophiles, a _This Week In Machine Learning and AI_ podcast with Lucian Resende, who presented in the same track, on [Scaling Jupyter Notebooks](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-261-scaling-jupyter-notebooks-with-luciano-resende/).  
  
I also note that Fernando Perez gave a [lecture](https://brown.columbia.edu/the-brown-institute-welcomes-prof-fernando-perez/) yesterday on _Pervasive, open data science in the next decade: a view from Jupyter_ as part of the Brown Institute Distinguished Lecture Series in Computational Innovation. Will a replay be available, I wonder?  
 

Adoption
--------

International technology company and tech trackers, Thoughtworks, _\[no, me neither...—Ed.\]_ have moved Jupyter to "Adopt" in their[ latest tech tracking survey](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/jupyter), with a caveat on production use. [Polyglot programming](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming) also get the adopt nod, which things like Rpy2, as well as BeakerX and SoS notebooks, already support...  
  
There are more and more notebook services out there that provide the means to run demo notebooks on a temporary / disposable server. For example, _notebooks.ai__\[notebooks.rmotr.com, as was_ \[[PR](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/pull/679)\]_...—Ed.\]_. Here's an [example JupyterLab tutorial](https://notebooks.ai/rmotr-curriculum/interactive-jupyterlab-tutorial-ac5fa63f) — fork it to run it... _\[A lot of these new services must be unsustainable in the long run... Lot's of blooming, at the moment, but then what...? Someone has to pay for the servers and storage somewhere / somehow... —Ed.\]_  
  
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC), "an independent, international nonprofit" _\[so that'll be a US corp then? —Ed.\]_, has [announced](https://items.ssrc.org/social-media-and-democracy-research-grants-grantees/) the first recipients of its social media and democracy research grants for analysing shed loads _\[technical term... —Ed.\]_ of Facebook data. A [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/SolomonMg/status/1122907792795422721) from Facebook research scientist @SolomonMg, drops a few hints about the platform that will be used to provide access to the data: _"MFA, VPN-only, pen-tested access to JupyterHub on secure servers. Access to data insights occurs by writing Pythonic, SparkML-flavored queries that deliver differentially private results"_.  
  
As an example of how just everyday, mundane, access to Jupyter notebooks is becoming, here's how folk in educational institutions down under can [launch a notebook on Cloudstor](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/7qJ2r6ySmyIuIU0).  
  
For users of the **[nuclio](https://nuclio.io/)** serverless platform, [nuclio/nuclio-jupyter](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio-jupyter) provides magic support for automatically generating and deploying nuclio serverless functions created from Jupyter notebooks.  
  
Content publisher **Nextjournal** have announced their [public beta](https://nextjournal.com/mk/public-beta). The offering includes, but isn't limited to, Jupyter notebook style authoring, secrets management and automatic version control. There's a free plan for open projects (no secrets, though drafts are private), with the pro-researcher plan starting at $99 researcher/month.  
  
Enterprise Internet of Things platform Losant have [added notebooks](https://www.losant.com/blog/platform-update-2019-04-25) to their platform, with graphical workflow tools supporting [notebook execution](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/outputs/notebook-execute/) calls as well as [notebook triggers](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/triggers/notebook/) that are fired when a notebook finishes executing.  
  
And IBM's **Cognos Analytics** v.11.1.2 now includes [notebook support](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_11.1.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.ag_manage.doc/t_ca_manage_configuring_notebooks.html)...  
  
Cloudron, the online app store for 1-click service and application running, recently added a [1-click Cloudron installer for Jupyter Hub](https://cloudron.io/store/org.jupyter.cloudronapp.html).  
  
If you prefer a DIY install route from the ground up, and want to install a Jupyter notebook container on **Kubernetes**, [this](https://cwienczek.com/2018/05/jupyter-on-kubernetes-the-easy-way/) is one of the simplest Jupyter / Kubernetes deployment guides I've seen... \[_though I've yet to try it...—Ed.\]_  
 

From the Literature...
----------------------

_Or more likely, the preprint servers, because if it was from the formal academic journal literature, it'd be about IPython notebooks and anyone without university credentials wouldn't be able to afford to read it..._  
  
I quite like aphorisms and rules of thumb as quick checks, or _lenses_, for reviewing anything, really. So here's another candidate for the toolbox: _Three principles of data science: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS)_ \[[arXiv:1901.08152](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08152)\]: _"\[a\]__t the conceptual level, the PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check, computability to ensure that an analysis is tractable, and stability to test the reproducibility of a data result against perturbations throughout the entire data science life cycle__"_.  
  
A new paper on arXiv promises _A Systematic Analysis of Jupyter Notebooks from Research Articles_ \[[arXiv:1905.00092](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00092)\] (fully titled, _"Reproducible Research is more than Publishing Research Artefacts"_). 4 pages, 5 figures, 1 table...  
  
Complement that sort of approach with the way that _Concerns about the reliability of publicly available SNe Ia data_ \[[arXiv:1905.00221](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00221)\] provides _"Jupyter notebooks and URLs in order to allow the reader to ascertain the veracity of \[claimed\] assertions"_, and you start to see how we might start to improve the critical reading of certain publications...  
  
Just announced, [A Large-scale Study about Quality and Reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks](https://2019.msrconf.org/event/msr-2019-papers-a-large-scale-study-about-quality-and-reproducibility-of-jupyter-notebooks) takes the MSR 2019 FOSS Award from its study of 1.4 million notebooks on GitHub. _\[There's been a lot of sharing recently on social media of a post on how the number of ipynb notebooks on Github is growing exponentially. By 2050, there'll be more of them than there are atoms in all the grains of sand on all the beaches in the universe, or something... The number of such announcements, and RTs of each one, are also growing exponentially...—Ed.\]_  
 

Weak Signals on the Twitterz
----------------------------

_A sample of things that people have been saying over the last couple of weeks or so... So what does it tell us?! \[Good segway from the previous item, eh? —Ed.\]_  
  
A [retweet](https://twitter.com/BrownInstitute/status/1124058595866370048) from @BrownInstitute suggests that in _"Columbia Libraries Jupyter notebooks are used extensively at @columbiajourn"..._  
  
...and an Asst Prof and writer [notes](https://twitter.com/jaheppler/status/1125802491961069568):_ "\[t\]he HCC introduced their Jupyter Hub to help alleviate the clunkiness of doing data analysis from the command line. Now code can be written and executed in online notebooks instead"_.  
  
A data scientist [asks](https://twitter.com/robertritz88/status/1125959493085323264): _"\[d\]oes Grammarly have API access for developers? I'm writing a lot more in Jupyter Notebooks and it would be great to be able to make a grammar checking plugin"_...  
  
... whilst in a self-proclaimed _"s__lightly off topic"_ tweet_\[from what, I have no idea...—Ed\]_, a medical doctor [ruminates](https://twitter.com/ABSamma/status/1125129552093745152) _"@observablehq ... web notebooks & web tech for data visualization instead of jupyter staples"_ and then floats the idea _\[as I have, as I have...—Ed.\]__"next frontier for @TiddlyWiki?"__\[Wouldn't that be... crazy?! Get yer hidden state'n'execution order gripes round that, naysayers... —Ed.\]_  
  
A senior scientist [reflects](https://twitter.com/EdHenry_/status/1126604491141328896): _"\[a\] few years ago I always started hacking together ideas in Jupyter, I've now shifted back to my IDE for hacking the idea and then port the idea to Jupyter for the story telling. Anyone else experience this?"_...  
  
...while someone doing something with verticals [shares some of my concerns](https://twitter.com/conner_xyz/status/1126574250285043714): _"Jupyter Lab got it wrong modeling the project after IDEs. Jupyter notebooks are about higher-order learnings facilitated by interactivity + an app like UX. Lab went down the stack instead of up. The next real advance in the space will look more like Google Drive than IntelliJ"_. _\[I think there are several forks in the road up ahead somewhere, including this one: Jupyter backed scary tools for developers and production use on the one hand, Jupyter backed customised notebook style authoring environments for mortal users on the other...—Ed.\]_  
  
A civil engineering ug [admits](https://twitter.com/kaleslut_/status/1125637836173012993): _"I’m trying to actually learn JavaScript & React so I can contribute to JupyterLab and I got an extension to build!! I’m so excited about it"_...  
  
...and a researcher [effuses](http://twitter.com/glchristeson/status/1123590628145881088): _"\[e\]xcited to say that our synthesis paper on ocean crust structure, which includes this extensive Jupyter notebook, has just been accepted! And to think, a year ago I took my first online Python course, inspired by all the tweets about the versatility of Jupyter notebooks!"_ In another, they [enthuse](https://twitter.com/glchristeson/status/1123932073662742529): _"\[o\]ne of my reviewers said he/she knew nothing about python, downloaded the software, and was able to run the Jupyter notebook and reproduce my figures!"_. _\[FTW. Game over. —Ed.\]_  
  
And finally, a prof at the University of Montreal [promises](https://twitter.com/pierre_bellec/status/1122909908704169984): _"coming soon: a new binder hub based @ComputeCanada , with a new tool to import large datasets into a binder"_.  
 

Making Progress?
----------------

Extensions like the [Multi Outputs Notebook Extension](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/11/quick-review-jupyter-multi-outputs-notebook-extension/) (#TJ12) provide useful **visual feedback** in the form of cell background colour coding to show you the current run status of cells in a notebook. But what if your notebook code contains loops that take a long time to run? If you have a cell that is taking its time because it's iterating something, why not add a progress meter or **progress bar indicator** to show how far through the loop the code has currently got?  
  
If you fancy rolling your own based on the humble print statement, [this recipe](https://mikulskibartosz.name/how-to-display-a-progress-bar-in-jupyter-notebook-47bd4c2944bf) shows you how. However, there are also several widgets out there that play nicely with notebooks that do exactly that.  
  
The Jupyter friendly progress bar I'm most familiar with is **[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)**, a _"fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI"_ that plays nicely with notebooks _and_ pandas _\[which means you can easily knock up a progress bar for df.apply() statements...—Ed.\]_ By the by, I note from the repo that rather than providing a button for running a demo on MyBinder, there's a button that launches a demo notebook on _notebooks.ai_.  
  
Alternatively, **[fastai/fastprogress](https://github.com/fastai/fastprogress)** provides a _"simple and flexible progress bar for Jupyter Notebooks"_ as well as the console created originally to support the fast.ai machine learning courses _\[where I imagine there is a lot of need-to-wait-while-it-trains activity?! —Ed.\]_. One thing I really like about the demo animations is the suggestion that you can use the library not only to display a progress bar, but also provide a handy way of updating a chart that is fed with data from whatever thing you're iterating around. _\[It doesn't work for me in MyBinder though — the ipywidgets are not liked for some reason — so it goes back to the bottom of my 'one to try out' pile for now... —Ed.\]_

Third up, the** [alphatwirl/atpbar](https://github.com/alphatwirl/atpbar)** provides _"progress bars for threading and multiprocessing tasks on terminal and Jupyter Notebook"_. If you run multiple jobs using _threading_ or _multiprocessing_, you can assign each one its own progress bar and they'll each update independently. _\[I'm not sure how this compares with something like the [nbmultitask](https://github.com/micahscopes/nbmultitask) multithreading/multiprocessing ipywidgets? —Ed.\]_

_\[Thinks: I can also imagine "notebook execution progress" meters for notebooks where you've "Run All" that shows an indicator in a notebook toolbar on on a notebook homepage "Running" tab... —Ed.\]_  
  
As far as platforms go, [_Apache Spark in Azure HDInsight_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview), Microsoft's implementation of Apache Spark in the cloud, now incorporates several [ops related visualisations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/understanding-hdinsight-spark-jobs-and-data-through-visualizations-in-the-jupyter-notebook/), including a Spark job progress indicator _"with a real time progress bar"_ and a _"step-by-step cell execution progress / status indicator displayed beneath a cell"_ that also posts _"an execution summary with the total duration and end time"_ when the cell execution completes.​  
  
_A round up of some code profiling tools for reporting on the time taken to execute different code components will appear in a forthcoming edition of Tracking Jupyter._  
 

Training Data Annotation / Tagging Extensions
---------------------------------------------

With notebooks being widely used for scripting machine learning training regimes, it's not surprising that other aspects of the machine learning workflow are making it into the notebook environment, such as annotating training data sets. Several notebook based tools seem to be out there that can help support this effort, which I'll take in an -ish chronological order...

From the literature (Suvorov R., Shelmanov A., Smirnov I. (2018) [Active Learning with Adaptive Density Weighted Sampling for Information Extraction from Scientific Papers](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71746-3_7). In: Filchenkov A., Pivovarova L., Žižka J. (eds) Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language. AINL 2017. Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 789. Springer, Cham), _\[which immediately makes me invoke the checks: a) is it dated? b) is it still supported? —Ed.\]_ comes the [active learning toolbox](https://github.com/IINemo/active_learning_toolbox), _"an interactive approach to simultaneously building a labeled dataset and training a machine learning model. AL algorithm"_. The workflow seems to be: bootstraps training with a bit of tagging, learn a bit, use the best learned tags as estimates for future training. Examples include the MNIST dataset. Whilst the repo looks a bit stale, a new branch (_"Create branch for sequence labeling")_ has just appeared...

Another repo that seems to be "resting" is for [pigeon](https://github.com/agermanidis/pigeon), _"a simple widget that lets you quickly annotate a dataset of unlabeled examples from the comfort of your Jupyter notebook. Pigeon currently supports annotation for classification tasks (set of labels), regression tasks (int/float range), or captioning tasks (variable-length text)"_. Handy for tagging image files from a set of predefined tags _at the file level_, but want if you want to tag a particular area _within_ an image file?  
  
For that, you might want to check out [Innotater](https://github.com/ideonate/jupyter-innotater), a rather more polished tool that lets you _"annotate data, including image bounding boxes, inline within your Jupyter notebook in python"_ (you can also tag other data types, such as text strings). There's a nice worked example [here](https://github.com/ideonate/butterflies) with a supporting article, [Clean Up your own Model Data without leaving Jupyter](https://towardsdatascience.com/clean-up-your-own-model-data-without-leaving-jupyter-bdbcc9001734).  
  
At first glance, you might think the UEA Computer Vision [Image Labelling Tool](https://bitbucket.org/ueacomputervision/image-labelling-tool/src/master/) _isn't_ runnable on MyBinder because the repo is on Bitbucket, not Github, but that's not true, because MyBinder can [launch from any git repo](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/05/09/mybinder-launches-from-any-git-repository-github-bitbucket-etc/) including Bitbucket _\[you need to remember to install and enable the extension if you do try it... —Ed.\]_. What it provides is _"a light-weight image labelling tool for Python designed for creating segmentation datasets, \[c\]urrently support\[ing\] simple polygonal labels, box labels, point labels and grouping"_.  
  
There's Jupyter support for commercial tagging / annotation tools too, such as for [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) and its [jupyterlab-prodigy](https://github.com/gnestor/jupyterlab-prodigy) extension.  
 

Getting Animated
----------------

Picking up on the idea of animated widgets and running with it in a slightly different direction, here are a few handy examples of how to create and render animations in a Jupyter notebook. _\[These may not work in JupyterLab.... it handles matplotlib animation rendering differently to notebooks, I think? Erm... Or did I just imagine I read that somewhere? —Ed.\]_  
  
Back in the mists of time, [JSAnimation](https://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation), as described in[Embedding Matplotlib Animations in Jupyter as Interactive JavaScript Widgets](http://louistiao.me/posts/notebooks/embedding-matplotlib-animations-in-jupyter-as-interactive-javascript-widgets/), provided an IPython notebook-compatible Javascript/HTML viewer for _matplotlib_ animations. This has since been merged into matplotlib's [Animation](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.animation.Animation.html) class (as of v. 2.1) as a core library supporting the _to\_jshtml()_ matplotlib method that allows you to _"embed an interactive JavaScript widget for playback of Matplotlib animations directly inside a Jupyter Notebook"_. _\[A to\_html5\_video() method is also available for rendering animation as a video file. —Ed.\]_  
  
[animatplot](https://animatplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) \[[repo](https://github.com/t-makaro/animatplot)\] builds on matplotlib to provide an easier way in to creating animations, but be warned: creating animations may take some time as they're created from plots generated a frame at a time _\[animation creation could do with a progress bar indicator, maybe?! —Ed.\]_ To run on MyBinder, you'll need to_ pip install Pillow_; example notebooks are in the _docs/source/gallery_.  
  
For animating the impulse response of an audio filter, there's this [rather neat demo](https://github.com/mgeier/python-audio/blob/master/plotting/matplotlib-animation.ipynb). (If you _wget_ the  raw notebook into an MyBinder container built from the _animatplot_ repo, you can then view the animation using _IPython.display.HTML(ani.to\_jshtml())_  ).  
  
[Graphics with Python and Numpy](https://thndl.com/gpn/) is a notebook converted to HTML that provides a recipe for doing exactly what it says on the tin with an abstract set of created shapes. I couldn't find the original notebook anywhere, but this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47138762/454773) provided a handy recipe for convert the notebook html back to ipynb.  
  
The [apsg](https://github.com/ondrolexa/apsg) structural geology package for Python, which _"defines several new python classes to easily manage, analyze and visualize orientational structural geology data"_, includes the neat demonstration of [stereonet animations in APSG](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ondrolexa/apsg/blob/master/examples/animation_example.ipynb).  
  
If the gyromotion of a charged particle is more your thing, you may prefer this [demonstration](https://scipython.com/blog/gyromotion-of-a-charged-particle-in-a-magnetic-field/).
