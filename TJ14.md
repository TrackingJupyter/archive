Tracking Jupyter Newsletter, the Fourteenth...
==============================================

by Tony Hirst

Welcome to this fourteenth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ14).  
  
The options for this this newsletter were: put it off, or send out fragments. I decided to put it off.. then thought I'd just get the least fragmented fragments out lest the task becomes a Sisyphean one...  
 

News
----

Fixing a cross-site inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability a couple of weeks ago and soon after the 5.7.5 release that fixed a Tornado 6 issue, [Jupyter notebooks 5.7.6](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-notebook-xssi-security-fix-546cd95babb0) was released. If you run notebooks and don't have an update strategy in place, as they become more widespread the bad guys may start looking to exploit the vulnerabilities. _\[Yes, this means more sysadmin work. But that's what happens as stuff go enterprise:-( —Ed.\]_  
  
The Jupyter notebook extension to kernel gateway (**nb2kg**) also bumped up to version [0.6.0](https://github.com/jupyter/nb2kg/releases/tag/v0.6.0), now including Tornado 6 support...  
  
... and IPython is now at [7.4.0](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/release-of-ipython-7-4-0/557).  
  
I also note a contributed [Debian packaged version of JupyterHub](https://github.com/1and1/debianized-jupyterhub#jupyterhub-debian-packaging)...  
  
Not strictly a Jupyter thang, but nevertheless, big news in the world of browser based computing / reporting environments: Mozilla have released an early preview of **[iodide](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/)**, _"an experimental tool \[for writing interactive reports within the browser\] meant to help scientists write beautiful interactive documents using web technologies"_ _\[I'd like to see a comparison with Observeable somewhere? —Ed.\]_  
  
What's perhaps most notable about iodide is a component it runs: _**[Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide)**, the Python science stack in the browser, compiled to WebAssembly_. So whereas things like Brython give you core Python 3, sort of, in the browser, now you can have _pandas_. With _"transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python"_ this means that _"\[w\]hen inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs"_. When I tried, my laptop fan went into overdrive, but the developers claim that _"running the Python interpreter inside a Javascript virtual machine adds a performance penalty, but that penalty turns out to be surprisingly small — in our benchmarks, around 1x-12x slower than native on Firefox and 1x-16x slower on Chrome. Experience shows that this is very usable for interactive exploration."_  
  
The [March release of Azure Data Studio](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2019/03/18/the-march-release-of-azure-data-studio-is-now-available/) is now available, which includes integrated SQL Server 2019 notebook support; here's a _"[quick video introduction](https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event18/Introducing_Azure_Data_Studio) to SQL Notebooks at the 20 minute mark"_.   
  
Trying to identify notebook best practice, as well as tooling to support effective notebook use, is starting to become a thing. A new paper out for SIGchi 2019, [Managing Messes in Computational Notebooks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/managing-messes-in-computational-notebooks/) looks at how notebook code can quickly become something of a mess and explores several possibly extensions that might be able to handle that mess. _\[Personally, I find the cell execution colouring feature of the [Jupyter-multi\_outputs extension](https://github.com/NII-cloud-operation/Jupyter-multi_outputs) (TJ12) really helpful. Here's my [quick review](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/11/quick-review-jupyter-multi-outputs-notebook-extension/)... I think it also could add to accessibility.. —Ed.\]_  
  
However, if it's a real mess you want, I don't get this at all... [cell execution replays](https://www.amie.ai/#/fern)._ \[Is it really, really useful, or is it just confusing? —Ed.\]_  
  
A new [Jupyter accessibility working group](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility) has been announced: [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfYw9wuZq1aFvZs1ZV8Z9-VQgQbcInYtEna79oPEaPl3KcqQ/viewform?fbzx=6408911192987986445). I've looked **[jupyter-a11y](https://github.com/jameslmartin/jupyter-a11y)** before (turn cells to speech) and keep thinking I'd like to see that integrated with [nbplayer](https://github.com/Calysto/nbplayer), which lets you play a notebook a step at a time in an interactive text terminal. A recent post on [productivity tips for Jupyter (Python)](http://https://towardsdatascience.com/productivity-tips-for-jupyter-python-a3614d70c770) also looks like it might include a couple of useful features that can support accessibility, such as playing a sound when a cell has finished executing, or a when cell execution raises an error.  
  
In the education sphere, there's now a [Jupyter Cloud XBlock for Open edX via Google Colab](https://iblnews.org/2019/03/15/jupyter-cloud-xblock-for-open-edx-via-google-colaborate/). This provides _"an easy way to launch a Jupyter Notebook environment \[on Google Colab\] from an Open edX-based learning platforms"_.  
  
Widget-wise, this may be useful: [ipytree](http://https://github.com/QuantStack/ipytree), a new interactive tree widget based on the Jupyter-widgets protocol and _jsTree_.  
  
And finally, for anyone in the West Country of the UK, [Python Data Science Taster Workshops For Children (Teachers and Parents, too!)](https://sites.google.com/view/python-datascience-for-kids/) currently planned to be held at the following locations: _The Poly Falmouth, Saturday May 4th, 13.30 - 15.30; Studio 13 at Krowji Redruth, Friday May 10th 13.30-15.30; Royal Cornwall Museum, Saturday May 18th 13.30-15.30; CAST Helston, TBA Old Library, Bodmin, Saturday June 8th 13.30-15.30; Penryn Campus, Falmouth University, TBA._  
  
 

Taking Computing to the People....
----------------------------------

Jupyter notebooks are not just for the ML folk. They're also bringing computing to a wider audience.  
  
One of the things I have come to realise over the years is that creating graphical user interfaces intended for use in production is HARD, but rolling your own quick and dirty interface as an end-user developed application can be easy. _\[I think this is one reason why a loat of research software sucks for anyome other than the researcher who developed it. —Ed.\]_ So it there a sensible middle ground? Maybe we should be looking for more _Generou__s Interfaces_? For example, patrons of The _Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision_ get a chance to customise queries via Jupyter notebooks: [Escaping the Lobby](http://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-11-generous-interfaces):

> We identified three types of tasks that are not sufficiently supported by existing interfaces - overview, investigation and analysis. In our example, the archive manager wants an overview - general statistics about the archive. The project manager needs to do investigation - she needs statistics for a specific section of the archive, to find out how many hours of material on video carriers have not yet been digitised. Finally, the scholar wants to conduct an analysis - for a particular section of the archive, he wants to detect patterns in the metadata, in this case the change in words used to describe migrants.  
>   
> Each of these tasks boils down to the same essence; a combination of a query with an aggregation of the value of a given metadata field. The query selects the section of the archive that is of interest while the aggregation calculates the desired data. For the example of the project leader, she will search for all items on a video carrier that do not have a corresponding digital carrier and will calculate the sum of the duration of each carrier.  
>   
> Previously, this type of generous access to the data was limited to expert programmers working for the archive in question. ...  Our approach helps users of all skill levels obtain exactly the data they need, and processing it to get the answers they want. ... We have created pre-prepared notebooks that only need to be run to produce a standard set of statistics and visualisations for the Sound and Vision archive. Users can specify their own queries and aggregations by simply changing values in the functions.

There is also a write up presented to the _CHIIR '19 Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval_ — [CLARIAH Media Suite: a Hybrid Approach to System Design in the Humanities](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3298918).  
 

Hosted Notebook Publishing Platforms
------------------------------------

_\[This is a bit too fragmented / early to go for my liking, but hey, Sisyphus...—Ed.\]_  
  
I note that there are different sorts of provider starting to emerge that draw on Jupyter technologies:  
  
\- integrated platforms  / workbenches where you subscribe to their offering on a max users / per seat basis.  
\- integrated platforms/ workbenches provided by a sector agency or research organisation with member access  
\- hosting solutions where a server is set up for you;  
\- installation support where support is provided to help you install a server.  
  
There are an increasing number of online hosted services that support notebook powered publishing, although many of them without a clear business model that I can see...  
  
Here are some that passed through my feeds over the last few months _\[others are available...—Ed.\]_:

*   [rmotr](https://notebooks.rmotr.com/), a _"f__ree data science environment in the cloud. Access a complete Data Science environment in just a matter of seconds";_
*   [kyso](https://kyso.io/): _"create, upload and share your data-science notebooks, charts, datasets and articles"_; there's also a [kyso-io/jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/kyso-io/jupyterlab-extension) that lets you to publish notebook direct to the Kyso platform;
*   [Saturn Cloud](https://www.saturncloud.io/): _"cloud hosted Jupyter, ... the easiest way to get up and running with Jupyter"_ _\[apparently... —Ed.\]_
*   [Datalab](https://github.com/michaelchanwahyan/datalab): _JupyerLab-based open-source platform for scientific research for people of size mild scale team where sharing of code and dataset is allowed_ _\[made me think of nbgallery (#TJ11)...—Ed.\]_;
*   [Swiss Data Cube (SDC)](https://github.com/GRIDgva/SwissDataCube):  _"the SDC is using the CEOS Open Data Cube technology to provide access and analysis capabilities to all Landsat (5,7,8), Sentinel 1, and Sentinel 2 data covering Switzerland from 1984 to present days";_
*   [Spell](https://spell.run/): machine learning platform offering [shared Jupyter Workspaces](https://medium.com/@spellrun/shared-jupyter-workspaces-better-orgs-management-and-symlinked-resources-f54a81ac72d2)  (which is to say, shared _"collections of files, notebooks, and other resources related that can be run using a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab"_);
*   [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/): _"t__he first cloud built for the future. Powering next-generation applications and cloud ML/AI pipelines"_ _\[whatever the f... that's supposed to mean... I have no idea...—Ed.\]_

And finally, not a Jupyter UI, but it's not hard to imaginge a Jupyter backend to this: [workbenchdata](https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/intro-to-data-journalism), an open source project from Columbia Journalism School ([repo](https://github.com/CJWorkbench/cjworkbench)). As the Jupyter architecture is teased into separate, minimally viable parts, such as the [jupyter\_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server), I can easily imagine a day in the not too distant future where there will be a Cambrian explosion of new UIs being built to feed from Jupyter kernel powered backends...  
 

Doing the Geo-Thing in Jupyter Notebooks
----------------------------------------

_\[I started looking at maps and geodata again recently. Here's a round up of some of the ways you can do the mappy thing... —Ed.\]_  
  
There are several packages out that that allow you to create embedded interactive maps easily within a notebook, most notably **[ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet)** and [**folium**](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) (there's also a Google maps plugin, _[pbugnion/gmaps](https://github.com/pbugnion/gmaps)_). _\[I also had a go at my own [folium magic](https://github.com/psychemedia/ipython_magic_folium) some time ago... —Ed.\]_  
  
_ipyleaflet_ looks like it has (or will soon have) quite a tight integration with embedded _ipywidgets_, so that's maybe one to explore. _\[Reminds me a bit of ipywidgets integration in ipysheet... widgets everywhere! BY the by, I spotted a recent overview of those [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-spreadsheets-in-jupyter-32ab6ec0f4ff). —Ed.\]_  
  
More elaborately, Uber's _kepler.gl_ tool looks like it'll be coming to Jupyter notebooks soon ([roadmap](https://github.com/uber/kepler.gl/wiki/Kepler.gl-2019-Roadmap#keplergl-for-jupyter-notebook--rfc--)_\[Doh! — Ed.\]_).  
  
If you're after data to plot, ​satellite navigation company _Tomtom_ has a [mapping API](https://blog.goodaudience.com/python-tomtom-api-7c16d9fd7605) (free API key) and the UK Met Office has a [Datapoint weather forecast API](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/datapoint-python) _\[not sure about getting the key for that? —Ed.\]_  
  
One of my favourite geo packages is Geoff Boing's [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) _\[early demo of mine [here](https://blog.ouseful.info/2018/06/29/working-with-openstreetmap-roads-data-using-osmnx/), more recent one [here](https://github.com/psychemedia/crime-data-demo/blob/master/Police%20API%20Demo.ipynb).. —Ed.\]_. This lets you run searches over OpenStreetmap, getting back street information as a _networkx_ graph that you can do all manner of graph'n'plotting related things with...   
  
When it comes to working with data in general, _geopandas_ is a handy representation to use (_pandas_ dataframes plus a _geometry_ column containing a _shapely_ geodata type. It looks like there's a recent tutorial from Nicar19 [here](https://github.com/scottpham/nicar19-geopandas). Whilst the requirements specified in the repo _pipenv_ and _Makefile_ make it reproducible, they don't work with _repo2docker_ / MyBinder... _\[So you may have to do some work to get the demos working... —Ed.\]_  
  
There are also generic plotting libraries out there to help with the plotting of non-interactive maps. **[geoplot](https://github.com/ResidentMario/geoplot)**, _"a high-level Python geospatial plotting library. It's an extension to cartopy and matplotlib which makes mapping easy: like seaborn for geospatial"_, seems particularly useful in this respect.  
  
Geo's not just for flat earthers of course.  
  
[GeoViews](http://​https://github.com/pyviz/geoviews)is another Python library, [built on top of Holoviews](http://geo.holoviews.org/), that _"adds a family of geographic plot types based on the Cartopy library, plotted using either the Matplotlib or Bokeh packages"_ and that _"makes it easy to explore and visualize any data that includes geographic locations_". In part it differentiates itself by  offering _"support for multidimensional meteorological and oceanographic datasets, such as those used in weather, climate, and remote sensing research"_.  
  
Looking round a bit further _\[double doh! —Ed.\]_, [stripy](https://github.com/underworldcode/stripy) is a _2D spherical and Cartesian triangulation toolkit for (constrained) triangulation in Cartesian coordinates and on a sphere_ that offers a Python interface to TRIPACK and STRIPACK Fortran code " (Binder demo available, [paper](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-papers/blob/joss.01324/joss.01324/10.21105.joss.01324.pdf)). _\[Some of the meshes look lovely, but I have no idea what they represent... —Ed.\]_  
  
And looking further up, [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a _Python package to handle pixelated data on the sphere_ based on the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) scheme and bundling the HEALPix C++ library. _"HEALPix was developed to process Cosmic Microwave Background data from Cosmology experiments like BOOMERANG and WMAP but it is now used in other branches of Astrophysics to store data from all-sky surveys."_ The developers also encourage users from other disciplines to co-opt it and make use of it as they will. A [notebook tutorial](https://github.com/healpy/healpy/blob/master/doc/healpy_tutorial.ipynb) is available.  
  
  
_\[Working with graphs will form the special feature in the next edition of Tracking Jupyter... —Ed.\]_
