Tracking Jupyter Newsletter, the Thirteenth...
==============================================

by Tony Hirst

Welcome to this  thirteenth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ13).  
  
It's been three weeks since the last one, and it's not getting easier. The lack of a structured wiki, or similar, for capturing and organising resources that I had intended to to use as the basis for the workflow never happened, and now I'm way behind, with resource links scattered everywhere. What future newsletters might look like, what form they may take, and how often they might appear, is anyone's guess...   
  
_If you want to show your support, help one of the companies local to me ramp up in advance of their [new exansion](https://www.countypress.co.uk/news/17457377.factory-expansion-to-create-100-new-isle-of-wight-jobs/) and invest in a quality T-shirt or sweatshirt (the material quality, that is: I can't speak for the design..._\[except that it's all my fault... —Ed\]_). Designs include: [Excel Went](https://ouseful.teemill.com/product/excel-went/), [Excel Won't](https://ouseful.teemill.com/product/excel-wont/) and [ExExcel](https://ouseful.teemill.com/product/exexcel/)._

News
----

A few weeks old now, but in case you missed it, _[elife](https://elifesciences.org/labs/ad58f08d/introducing-elife-s-first-computationally-reproducible-article)_[ published its first reproducible article](https://elifesciences.org/labs/ad58f08d/introducing-elife-s-first-computationally-reproducible-article) _\[you can see the article [here](https://repro.elifesciences.org/example.html#) —Ed.\]_. Tim Head provides some of the background (MyBinder backend, builds on from Binder+Stencila integration) [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/mybinder-org-powers-elifes-first-reproducible-article-demo/406). Nature also picked up on the news — [Pioneering ‘live-code’ article allows scientists to play with each other’s results](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00724-7) — although without mentioning [their first experiment](https://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) with IPython notebooks, as they were then known, from back in 2014.  
  
Mentions of Jupyter are increasingly starting to appear in the wider open-source community. For example here's a recent article in _Linux Journal_: [By Jupyter--Is This the Future of Open Science?](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/jupyter-future-open-science)  
  
In Microsoft land, it seems you can now use notebooks in [**SQL Server** 2019 preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/notebooks-guidance).  
  
_\[This further emphasises the trend that **Jupyter notebooks are increasingly becoming embedded in other applications as user interface layer.** Notebook UIs will soon become commonplace... The read/write web has returned:-) —Ed.\]_  
  
Their docs and Binderised demos are lagging a bit, I think, but shared videos around the latest release of [QuantStack/ipysheet](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipysheet​) suggest you can now put arbitrary widgets inside _ipysheet_ cells. So if you want sheets where cell values are linked to widgets, or maps or [multivolume renderers](https://twitter.com/maartenbreddels/status/1101516060644331520) inside cells, you can do._ \[I am just getting increasingly confused by what may or may not be possible with all these pieces...!—Ed.\]_  
  
For your listening pleasure, episode 201 of the [Talk Python To Me](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/podcast/talk-python-to-me-python-conversations-for-passionate/id979020229) podcast has a Jupyter theme.  
  
Not really a Jupyter thing, but it may be relevant behind the scenes? A method for [Parsing Gigabytes of JSON per Second](https://branchfree.org/2019/02/25/paper-parsing-gigabytes-of-json-per-second/).  
  
Old news, but something I'm not sure I'd noticed before: [RISE slideshows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/present-jupyter-notebooks-slideshow) are available by default on _Azure Notebooks_...  
 

Package Updates
---------------

**Jupyter notebook** bumped up to [5.7.5](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#release-5-7-5), in part to fix an issue caused by a recent _tornado_ update to version 6 of that package.  
  
**IPython** also bumped up to [7.3.0](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version7.html#ipython-7-3-0), bringing in compatibility with Python 3.8.

Deployment
----------

One for the lazydevs... If working through the Zero to JupyterHub guide is too laborious for you, how about using an executable Ansible playbook version of it?  [Zero to JupyterHub with Ansible](https://mast-labs.stsci.io/2019/02/zero-to-jupyterhub-with-ansible) shows you how, using AWS as the target deployment infrastructure ([repo](https://github.com/spacetelescope/z2jh-aws-ansible)).  
 

Notebooks Everywhere...
-----------------------

As well as becoming embedded in other applications, provider-hosted notebooks are also being used widely to deliver interactive documentation, tutorials and workflow recipes.  
  
For example:

*   _Azure Notebooks_ is Microsoft's free hosted notebook service. Along with [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/databricks/), it's used by **Azure Sentinel** to _"provide security insights and actions to investigate anomalies and hunt for malicious behaviors"_ across the enterprise ([review](https://robertsmit.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/first-look-on-the-new-azure-sentinel-cloud-native-with-azure-notebooks-free-service-jupyter-siem-siemaas-azure-sentinel/)).
*   [ArcGIS Jupyter notebooks](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/using-the-jupyter-notebook-environment/) are now a thing, with some nice demo notebooks on this [ESRI hosted Jupyter tmpnb server](https://notebooks.esri.com/).

Amazon Sagemaker also makes use of Jupyter notebooks. As with all AWS products, it's more 10-click than 1-click to get started... here's a write up of [how to launch a Jupyter notebook on Amazon Sagemaker](https://ramasankarmolleti.com/2019/03/05/how-to-create-jupyter-notebook-using-amazon-sagemaker/) _\[that looks a couple of steps easier than the route I had to figure out for myself at an AWS AI Experience event... —Ed.\]._  
  
Other notebook technologies are available, of course. I'm not sure to what extent _Google Colab,_ Google's free hosted notebook service, uses Jupyter protocols underneath, or if, where and how the Colab forked from Jupyter roots? But it is a Jupyter notebook client at least in the sense it can open and run Jupyter _.ipynb_ files.  
  
More obviously other, [Oracle Machine Learning SQL Notebooks for the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud](https://blogs.oracle.com/datamining/introducing-oracle-machine-learning-sql-notebooks-for-the-oracle-autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud) uses Apache Zeppelin notebooks.  
 

Shipping Runnable Environments
------------------------------

The [Archives Unleased project](https://archivesunleashed.org/) _"aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past_". Their _Archives Unleashed Cloud_ application provides a range of tools for exploring the data, but as a recent blog post describes — [Exploring Web Archival Data through Archives Unleashed Cloud Jupyter Notebooks](https://news.archivesunleashed.org/exploring-web-archival-data-through-archives-unleashed-cloud-jupyter-notebooks-7605c6ca2b33) — _"if you do not know what kind of research is possible with web archives, how can you develop your research questions?_".  
  
Their aims are laudable: _"\[w\]e want the Cloud to provide nice visuals to analyze archive data, but we also want to make how we do that as transparent as possible"_.  
  
But their possible user groups are diverse: _"The digital humanists might want detailed tutorials that walk students through the process of using Python to analyse web archive data. The librarians and archivists may or may not be Python-savvy, but either way, they should not need to walk through detailed Python documentation to promote their collection. It should work out of the box."_  
  
One solution is to use **_"Jupyter Notebooks as a Fair Compromise"_**. To complement the online service, the project maintains a [repo](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/auk-notebooks) of notebooks _"to assist in creating additional analysis and visualizations of Archives Unleashed Cloud derivatives"_. The repo is Dockerised and runs on Binderhub as well as in a standalone Docker container.  
  
_\[Getting access to Docker infrastructure is then the issue... —Ed.\]_

Better By Default?
------------------

Keeping track of extensions — and keeping track of effective set-ups based around certain notebook combinations — could be a full-time tracking project in its own right _\[that's the thing about combinations: they explode... —Ed.\]_.  
  
For example, here's the [official unofficial _(sic)_ notebook extension distribution](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and there are loads more _unofficial_ unofficial extensions out there too...  
  
One such example I spotted recently is [nbzip](https://github.com/data-8/nbzip), which lets you download a zip file containing the contents of a listed directory on the Jupyer notebook homepage.  
  
A handy looking not-quite-an-extension yet _\[you're pointed to [this](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Data-Analysis/tree/master/setup) and expected to enter sys-admin mode to get it installed and working...—Ed.\]_ that appeared in a blog post that seemed to be widely shared on social media, [setup](https://towardsdatascience.com/set-your-jupyter-notebook-up-right-with-this-extension-24921838a332) "nudges" you towards setting up better defaults on your notebook setup in the form of notebook templates and preloaded packages.  
  
​_This sort of thing has a place in content production environments and educational settings where the notebook is a means to an end for folk who might benefit from using code to get things done, compared to a comp-sci educational setting where you may expect a bit more understanding of, and tolerance for, not hiding the boilerplate code stuff..._  
  
That said, if you've been keeping up more generally, there's already a [jupyterlab\_templates](https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab_templates) extension which allow you to open notebooks from a selection of templates in JupyterLab at least.  
 

Proxies
-------

One of the things I still don't have a clear picture in my mind about is the role of proxies in Jupyter deployments. \[_We need some [more cartoons](https://hackmd.io/g-0JchAgRDGCrRxwbqx-wA)... —Ed.\]_  
  
At the single notebook server level, the original _nbserverproxy_, now renamed as [jupyter-server-proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy), provides a server extension to proxy web services in the context of a single user: if you want to be able to access RStudio or OpenRefine via notebook server authenticated access on a notebook URL path, _jupyter-server-proxy_ is what you want. _jupyter-server-proxy_ generalises over previous application specific proxies such as the original [openrefineder](https://github.com/betatim/openrefineder) proxy, and is called on by things like or [nbrsessionproxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbrsessionproxy) (RStudio / shiny proxy) and [nbstencilahostproxy](https://github.com/stencila/nbstencilahostproxy) (Stencila proxy).  
  
For something like JupyterHub, a proxy is used to direct traffic to different user instances of an individual notebook server. The default proxy implementation for JupyterHub is currently configurable-http-proxy (CHP) but _"JupyterHub 0.8. opened the way towards allowing users to create custom proxy implementations based on their deployment needs"_. According to a recent post on the official Jupyter blog — [Introducing TraefikProxy — a scalable and highly available proxy for JupyterHub](https://blog.jupyter.org/introducing-traefikproxy-a-new-jupyterhub-proxy-based-on-traefik-4839e972faf6) — a new default proxy looks like it's on the way in the form of [JupyterHub Traefik Proxy​](https://github.com/jupyterhub/traefik-proxy) _"an implementation of the JupyterHub Proxy API based on traefik"_ that provides an _"extremely lightweight, portable reverse proxy implementation, that supports load balancing and can configure itself automatically and dynamically"_.  
  
The new proxy comes in two flavours:

*   _TraefikTomlProxy_, appropriate for smaller-scale deployments, uses an in-memory toml file to store routes;
*   _TraefikEtcdProxy_, which looks set to be integrated into zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s and the JupyterHub-on-Kubernetes Helm Chart, uses the _etcd_ distributed key-value store to persist the routing table.

_\[A performance analysis comparing both these approaches with the CHP solution is apparently on the way.. —Ed.\]_  
  
Traefik also features a Web UI dashboard _"which lists all of the registered frontends (the set of rules that determine how incoming requests are forwarded) and backends (the notebooks), the routing rules, some useful metrics, and other configuration elements"_.  
  
In a deployment across a wider system, where JupyterHub is one service among many provided by an organisation, or where _https_ access is being managed, there is also likely to be a front end reverse proxy (the official docs have [examples](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/config-proxy.html) of _nginx_ and _Apache_ reverse proxy config files). _\[Demonstrating my ignorance, is this also something the JupyterHub Traefik Proxy could also be configured to manage? —Ed.\]_  
 

Development environments
------------------------

Following on from previous _Tracking Jupyter newsletter_ announcements regarding Jupyter integration in Microsoft VSCode,  [PyCharm 2019.1 EAP 5](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2019/02/pycharm-2019-1-eap-5/) (February 21, 2019) announced Jupyter notebook support for the [PyCharm 2019.1](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2019.1/jupyter-notebook-support.html) professional edition and [PyCharm 2019.1 EAP 6](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2019/02/pycharm-2019-1-eap-6/) (February 28, 2019 ) included a variable viewer and an interpreter indicator in the status bar.  
  
If you're still holding out hoping that Spyder will continue having lost funding support some time ago, it also offers [Jupyter notebook integration](http://https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-notebook).  
  
For the old schoolers out there, [**Emacs** IPython Notebook (EIN)](https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook)  _\[or harking back to the days of recursive acronyms, "__EIN Is not only for Notebooks"..__. —Ed.__\]_ lets you edit and run [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks within Emacs.  
  
I never got into Ruby on Rails, or what [Integrating Jupyter Notebook and Rails](https://dev.to/yukiinoue/integrating-jupyter-notebook-and-rails-43cc) might actually mean, but now it seems that you can run _gem 'jupyter\_on\_rails'_ and _rake jupyter:notebook_ if you feel the need to_\[I have absolutely no idea if that's a Good Thing or not... —Ed.\]_  
 

Also On the Desktop...
----------------------

For Apple fans, [nbviewer-app](https://github.com/tuxu/nbviewer-app) is a _brew_ installable native macOS application for viewing Jupyter notebooks. Perhaps more interestingly, the [Carnets](https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets) stand-alone Jupyter notebook server and client for iOS is in pre-flight testing, so it may be on the way to app store near you soon?  
  
[nbopen](https://github.com/takluyver/nbopen) is a cross-platform Python utility that lets you open notebook in "nearest running" notebook server (or start one if one can't be found) by double clicking on an _.ipynb_ notebook file.  
  
And here's another approach that's new to me: running JupyterLab in [Chrome application mode](https://yoursdata.net/installing-and-configuring-jupyter-lab-on-windows/) rather than in a browser tab.  
  
_\[Remember, kids,_ nteract _and_ Stencila _are also out there... —Ed.\]_  
 

Widget Architectures
--------------------

One of the tensions created by the common Jupyter notebook interface fronting a wide variety of kernels is providing cross-kernel support for magics, which users might reasonably associate with functions that are generic ("magic") calls to functionality away from lines of program code native to the underlying kernel.  
  
In previous newsletters I've mentioned the [xwidgets](https://github.com/QuantStack/xwidgets) approach, which provides a C++ backend for Jupyter interactive widgets. This has now been complemented by [jvm-magics](https://github.com/jupyter/jvm-magics), which provides a plugin system for magic function implementations across JVM kernels and _"allows library authors to provide a way to expose Jupyter magic functions to JVM kernels"_ and _"kernel authors to call magic functions that are made available by libraries"_.  
  
Finding the best way of supporting interactive widgets as a standalone service is also an ongoing area of development. The [f](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/flask-ipywidgets)[lask-ipywidgets](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/flask-ipywidgets) package built on the now deprecated [ipywidgets\_server](https://github.com/pbugnion/ipywidgets_server) to let you use _ipywidgets_ from a Flask server to let you run Jupyter widgets outside of the notebook environment. The current leader in the field of _"r__endering of live Jupyter notebooks with interactive widgets"_ appears to be [voila](https://github.com/quantstack/voila), although things like [ScriptedForms](https://github.com/SimonBiggs/scriptedforms) also give you a quick way in at the expense of learning some new markup tags. On the backend, _voila_ uses the new [jupyter\_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/) rather than a notebook server. _\[The pieces for loosely joining are getting smaller, methinks? —Ed.\]_  
  
_I'm not sure how things like voila compare to IBM's [Pixiedust / Pixiegatway](https://github.com/pixiedust/pixiegateway) either, although activity on that repo appears to have stalled?_  
  
In terms of implementation, I have no idea what benefits (or otherwise) [ipymaterialui](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipymaterialui), a Jupyter widget implementation based on React Material UI components, might offer? I also don't fully get [jp\_proxy\_widget](https://github.com/AaronWatters/), _"a generic and easy to use Jupyter/IPython widget implementation that supports many types of javascript libraries and interactions"_ that offers _"support for uploading and downloading files, loading and using jQueryUI components, loading and using the requests.js module management system"_. If react-hooks mean anything to you, these [jupyter-react-hooks experiments](https://github.com/rgbkrk/jupyter-react-hooks) may entertain you... _\[As I type those words, the technologies they refer to mean absolutely nothing to me... —Ed.\]_  
  
I also get the feeling that [nteract/vdom](https://github.com/nteract/vdom), which allows you to write "user-friendly declarative Pythoic statements" _\[obvs... —Ed.\]_ to create _"__headings, prose, images, and more common user interface items \[in\] Jupyter frontends, such as nteract and JupyterLab", _is another jigsaw piece that falls into this part of the picture.  
 

Tensorflow et al
----------------

A round up of some more bits and pieces _about which **I know nothing**...__\[Tensorflow is Google's take on those deep learnin' things, right? By the by, I noticed you can now [buy TPU co-processors](https://coral.withgoogle.com/) on a board or a USB stick as well as [run TensorflowLite on microcontrollers](https://petewarden.com/2019/03/07/launching-tensorflow-lite-for-microcontrollers/)... —Ed.\]_  
  
[Jupyter-Tensorboard](https://github.com/lspvic/jupyter_tensorboard) is a Jupyter server extension that provides a graphical user interface for tensorboard (a visualization tool for tensorflow) that lets you_ "start, manage and stop"_ tensorboard instances. It also looks like it's already been integrated into at least one of the many "hosted ML workbench" providers that seem to be out there, [Domino Datalab](https://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000638263-Using-TensorBoard-in-Jupyter-workspaces).  
  
Tensorboard is also well supported in Google Colab, Google's forked variant of Jupyter notebooks. The post [How to use Tensorboard with PyTorch in Google Colab​](https://medium.com/logojoy-engineering/how-to-use-tensorboard-with-pytorch-in-google-colab-1f76a938bc34) describes how the the latest Tensorboard release lets you start a tensorboard process from a notebook directly with some IPython magic.  
  
If you don't have a TPU to hand, a bit of GPU support may help speed up model training, so here's yet another partial recipe for using an NVIDIA docker container that can provide [GPU Acceleration for TensorFlow](https://medium.com/@justinchuang/step-by-step-jupyter-notebook-on-pc-with-nvidia-gpu-and-nvidia-docker-2499ec9b7644).  
  
The whole Tensorflow thing seems to be becoming rather ecosystem like. For example, a Colab linked [Train and serve a TensorFlow model with TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/tutorials/Serving_REST_simple) tutorial makes use of TensorFlow Serving, a _"flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments"_.  
  
A whole raft of workflows and recipes also seem to be vying for attention around Tensorflow.  
  
For example, this post on [Apache Kafka + KSQL + TensorFlow for Data Scientists via Python + Jupyter Notebook](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/apache-kafka-ksql-tensorflow-for-data-scientists-via-python)asks "_Why would a data scientist use Kafka Jupyter Python KSQL TensorFlow all together in a single notebook?" \[I have no idea whatsoever... —Ed.\] _It seems that KSQL is _"a streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache Kafka \[that\] provides an easy-to-use, yet powerful interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka"_. The post is supported by a linked to[notebook](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/python-jupyter-apache-kafka-ksql-tensorflow-keras/blob/master/python-jupyter-apache-kafka-ksql-tensorflow-keras.ipynb) that shows how to _"integrate with events from a Kafka stream, preprocess data with KSQL (transformations, aggregations, filtering, etc.), prepare data for model training, train an analytic model with Keras and TensorFlow, predict data using the analytic model with Keras and TensorFlow, and \[not shown\] deploy the analytic model to a scalable Kafka environment leveraging Kafka Streams or KSQL"_ so you can try to make sense of it in a practical way if you want to...  
  
_\[As this issue descends into yet words that have no meaning to me, and describes technologies I haven't made time to play with, evaluate, or even just try to make sense of, yet, I think it's probably already way past the point at which it would have been sensible to stop... —Ed.\]_
