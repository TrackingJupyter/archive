Welcome to this twenty-eighth edition of the Tracking Jupyter newsletter (#TJ28).  
  
The world's gone a bit odd since the last edition, and whilst my daily routine is not really affected, working as I do from home anyway, I've taken the opportunity to start following the "how to work from home" guidance and essentially cut my working day by a third, taking the odd break, stopping at 5 to watch the daily briefing, and trying not to working in the evenings or weekends. So things like spending time on (computer based) sideprojects, such as the newsletter, have fallen off a cliff in favour of the garden, more time cooking and learning to play an instrument (badly)... _\[That said, putting together several chunks of this edition of the newsletter ended up wiping out my Sunday afternoon...—Ed.\]_  
  
Future newsletters may be more frequent, but briefer. Or maybe they won't... As it is, there no major thematic roundups this issue as I try to get back up to speed. That said, the next issue, with a focus in part on Jupyter in an  educational context, should be out in a few days...  
  
Take care, and stay safe, y'all...

News
----

Bedrock to the default kernel in many Jupyter environments, IPython [updated](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/release-of-ipython-7-14-and-5-10/4223) to v7.14, improving compatibility with Sphinx 3+ and matplotlib 3.3+, with some maintenance of v.5.10 for the Py2 users and [then](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version7.html#ipython-7-15) v7.15 _\[shows how long it's been since the last issue of TJ...—Ed.\]_, with bug fixes and user facing improvements and an attempt at providing "reproducible builds". Henceforth, effort will be directed at v8.  
  
Loosely related to that _\[not really...—Ed.\]_, from _@gradsflow_ on the Twitterz, a [handy tip](https://twitter.com/gradsflow/status/1266224859480088581), worth remembering: _"\[w\]hen you forget about the order in which you have run the cells in your notebook, or need  all of it at one place. Just run \`%history\` in a new cell"_. _\[__I also note that you can access the contents of an executed code cell using its IPython execution index number in a reference the cell history: \_ih\[CELL\_INDEX\] —Ed.\]_  
  
Notebook workflow automation tool Papermill is [now out](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/papermill-2-1-1-release/4134) at v2.1.1, with improved handling of reporting on failed executions.   
  
And new home for Jupyter Book, the Executable Book Project is [bumping up](https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/jupyter-book/releases) the Jupyter Book versions, with v0.6.5 [out](https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/jupyter-book/releases/tag/v0.6.5) as the last "legacy" release and v0.7.0bx _\[at the time of writing, out in testing... —Ed.\]_ representing a total rewrite of the Jupyter Book package.  
  
nbsphinx has moved up to v0.6.x, with the [0.6.0 release](https://github.com/spatialaudio/nbsphinx/releases/tag/0.6.0) dropping support for Py2 _\[poor, poor... \[just stop it right there...—MetaEd.\] —Ed.\]_, adding thumbnail galleries, and more. [Hidden cells](https://github.com/spatialaudio/nbsphinx/pull/436) look like they may also yet be supported... _\[They've been a long time coming...—Ed.\]_  
  
**nteract** [is now](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases/tag/v0.23.3) at v0.23.2, with fixes to CSS for collapsed outputs and CodeMirror syntax highlighting and improvements to the desktop menu.  
  
Something else new _\[and still very much under development...—Ed.\]_ from the _nteract_ folk, [pick](https://github.com/nteract/pick) _"lets you customize your virtual environments, conda environments, and Jupyter kernels \[on launch\]"_ using a new form of magic: _kernel magic_. So for example, using the cell block magic _%%kernel.conda-environment_ in a notebook, you can add something akin to the contents of a conda _environment.yml_ file, and set up the corresponding environment. They're also referring to this as a "kernel proxy" or dynamic kernel creator/spawner _\[which is something I really need to try to get my head round the consequences of! Like the build steps from Binder/repo2docker in a notebook? —Ed.\]_. I get the feeling this sort of thing could complement the Nordic HPC collective's [envkernel](https://github.com/NordicHPC/envkernel), which allows you to _"run jupyter kernels in different environments (conda, virtualenv, docker, singularity, Lmod)"_ by creating a kernel file that invokes envkernel to to run that kernel from the desired target when the kernel is started. _\[I'd love to see a diagram of what connects to what and what flows from where to where when using envkernel...—Ed.\]_  
  
If you'd rather just check on the state of your current environment from a notebook, then [jupyter-nbrequirements](https://github.com/thoth-station/jupyter-nbrequirements) may suffice, with a nice UI showing the presence, or otherwise, of required packages in your current environment.  
  
From recent social media hype, IBM seem to have _\[re-?—Ed.\]_[announced](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/blogs/open-source-elyra-ai-toolkit-simplifies-data-model-development/) the release of their [Elyra](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra) _"AI-centric extensions to Jupyter notebooks"_ toolkit \[[#TJ27](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ27.md#news)\] over on the IBM Developer blog.  
  
Awardees from the second cycle of the Chan-Zuckerberg Inititiate (CZI) [Essential Open Source Software for Science program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/?cycle=2) have been [announced](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/awards-3-8-million-open-source-software-projects-essential-science/), including support for another stab at [Real-Time Collaboration in Jupyter](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/real-time-collaboration-in-jupyter/) \[discussion repo here: [jupyterlab/rtc](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc)\]. Funding for projects in support of graph packages _[networkx](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/revitalizing-networkx-for-complex-network-analysis/)_ and _[igraph](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/providing-a-solid-foundation-for-network-analysis/)_ also feature, as well as for [Xarray](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/xarray-multidimensional-labeled-arrays-and-datasets-in-python/) (multidimensional labeled arrays) and the [VisPy](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/rebuilding-the-community-behind-vispys-fast-interactive-visualizations/) interactive scientific visualization library.  
  
In terms of specific subject area package development, [pymedphys](https://docs.pymedphys.com/) complements the [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) _"community effort to develop a common core package for Astronomy in Python and foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages"_, with a _"a community effort to develop an open standard library for Medical Physics in Python"_ \[[repo](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys)\].  
​  
Elsewhere, [ipyaladin](https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2020/05/04/the-cds-and-python-i-explore-the-sky-with-ipyaladin/) \[[repo](https://github.com/cds-astro/ipyaladin)\] embeds the interactive [Aladin Lite](https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/doc/) sky map viewer in a Jupyter notebook, with support for JPEG multi-resolution HEALPix all-sky surveys and tabular (VOTable) and footprints (STC-S) data overlays.  
  
Meanwhile, [pyiron](https://pyiron.github.io/) \[[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025618304786)\] provides _"a \[JupyterLab based\] integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science"_, offering amongst other things hierarchical data management using SQL and HDF5 storage resources and integrated, interactive molecular structure and trajectory visualizations based on the [NGLview](https://github.com/arose/nglview) widget.  
  
For GLAM folk _\[that is, folk in the galleries, libraries, archives, and museums sector...—Ed.\]_, the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/) provides a _"collection of tools, tutorials, examples, and hacks to help you work with data from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (the GLAM sector)"_, many of them notebook based. Whilst the primary focus is Australia and New Zealand, submissions relating to sources in other territories seem to be welcomed.  
  
Also in Python package land, and perhaps of interest to data analysing Jupyter users, I note that one of the nice things about the R universe is that there are quite a lot of data packages out there that publish datasets packaged as .RData files. If you want to make use of those in your default Python environment _without_ the need for external R depndencies, [pyreadr](https://github.com/ofajardo/pyreadr) is a Python package that lets you read and write R .RData and .Rds files into/from pandas dataframes.   
  
With lots of universities and colleges moving to online teaching, providing human support to online mediated computing lab class activities is likely to become "an issue". CoCalc has provided text and video chat support for many years_,_ but I don't recall anything similar in Jupyter-land. Until now, because Yuvi Panda has been tinkering again, this time with the [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) open source video conferencing app, and has come up with [jupyter-videochat](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyter-videochat), a JupyterLab extension offering video chat and screensharing support. If you fancy trying it, there's a Binderised demo [here](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyter-videochat-demo).  
  
Speaking of CoCalc _\[I did an early review [here](https://blog.ouseful.info/2015/11/24/course-management-and-collaborative-jupyter-notebooks-via-sagemathcloud/)...—Ed.\]_, they publish a set of [comparison tables](https://cocalc.com/doc/compare.html) that compare CoCalc's offering with those of MyBinder, Google Colaboratory (Colab), Microsoft Azure Notebooks, Datalore and DeepNote. For an independent take, you may prefer [this comparison](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/) of _"Six easy ways to run your Jupyter notebook in the cloud"_, which features Binder, Kaggle Kernels, Colab, Azure Notebooks, CoCalc and Datalore ([comparison table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12thaaXg1Idr3iWST8QyASNDs08sjdPd6m9mbCGtHFn0/edit#gid=1505836451)).  
  
If you're looking to allow users to log into your JupyterHub server from Facebook, there's a JupyterHub Facebook Authenticator, a Facebook OAuth authenticator built over the top of the JupyterHub OAuthenticator, available from the [facebookincubator/jupyterhub\_fb\_authenticator](https://github.com/facebookincubator/jupyterhub_fb_authenticator) Github repo.  
  
In passing, I also note that **LTI** 1.1 and 1.3 authenticators are now available in [IllumiDesk](https://github.com/IllumiDesk/illumidesk/tree/master/src/illumidesk/authenticators) \[[#TJ8](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ8.md)\], a containerised pre-bundled, quickstart Jupyter deployment for education that bundles JupyterHub and _nbgrader_, among other things.  
  
On spotting [jupyter-jsc.fz-juelich.de](https://jupyter-jsc.fz-juelich.de/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2Fstart), a _"customized JupyterHub solution that allows users to easily use JupyterLab on HPC Systems"_ _\[the component set-up repos can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter-jsc), but I didn't notice a zero-to guide...—Ed.\]_, I note that JupyterHub fronted access to supercomputer resources seems to be well on the way to being a commodity thing... _\[Which is to say, you're increasingly likely to be surprised if there_ isn't _a Jupyter UI available...—Ed.\]_  
  
Not strictly Jupyter, [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) provides _lightweight reactive notebooks for Julia_, with notebooks saved as pure Julia files. There's only a single cell type — code — but you can prefix a line to render markdown within it. A _@bind_ macro lets you link HTML objects with Julia variables _\[so ipywidget-like...—Ed.\]_.   
  
I mention this one because it was new to me, and although not really Jupyter either, and seemingly not open source _\[I couldn't see a repo anywhere...—Ed.\]_, [deckzero](https://app.deckzero.com/home) is a cell based, paged deck builder with text, code, media, data and 3D molecule cells and a nice drag and drop cell structure editor _\[in UI terms, it also reminds me a little bit of the [Workbench](https://workbenchdata.com/) scraper / data cleaning app...—Ed.\]_. The code cells didn't seem to render properly for me, and I'm not sure what's executing the code on the backend, but some nice ideas in there, and across the demos, that could be usefully pinched for possible Jupyter backed UIs.   
  
The popular **RISE** extension, which runs notebooks as interactive slideshows, is, like much of the Jupyter ecosystem, open source software. Whilst contributions are presumably welcome, so are other forms of support. So if you have a small bit of free budget and are interested in the odd tweak to the RISE extension, rather than just file a feature request as an issue _\[erm... pot... kettle... black...—Ed.\]_, why not [sponsor](https://damianavila.github.io/blog/posts/supporting-rise.html) an update?  
  
If you prefer **PowerPoint**, I'm not sure I appreciated this before, but Tim Paine's [jupyterlab\_powerpoint](https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab_powerpoint) extension seems to do roundtripping, which means you can convert notebooks to Powerpoint, PowerPoint to notebooks, or one to the other and back again...  
  
It's still not clear to me how whether notebooks are, or do, compete with Excel, or may yet come to do so. There are various packages out there offering interactive spreadsheet style notebook widgets, such as [QuantStack/ipysheet](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipysheet), but I'm not sure I've seen one that wraps the [x-spreadsheet](https://github.com/myliang/x-spreadsheet) Javascript package (_"a web-based JavaScript spreadsheet"_). I did spot this [Shiny/R-wrapper](https://r-posts.com/rxspreadsheet-a-new-library-for-editing-spreadsheets-with-shiny/) for it though... _\[Could be a good candidate for a quick jp\_proxy\_widget hack? —Ed.\]_ Document format-wise, [nb2xls](https://github.com/ideonate/nb2xls) converts Jupyter notebooks to Excel spreadsheets. Alternatively, if you want to call functions defined in a Jupyter notebooks from an Excel sheet, the [jupyterexcel](https://github.com/luozhijian/jupyterexcel) server extension seems to provide a JSON API to notebook defined functions that can be called from an Excel formula. The [xlwings](https://docs.xlwings.org/en/stable/) package seems to go a step further, "making it easy to call Python from Excel and vice versa"; features include automating Excel from Python _"using a syntax close to VBA"_, replacing VBA macros and user defined functions with Python code, and exposing Excel workbooks via a REST API. _\[If you're looking for a bit of free thinking around reimagined spreadsheet style UIs, this [paper](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/salon2020/) on "Wildcard: Spreadsheet-Driven Customization of Web Applications" is worth a read...—Ed.\]_  
  
And whilst we're on an Office roll, it perhaps worth mentioning as an aside the [jupyter-docx-bundler](https://github.com/m-rossi/jupyter-docx-bundler) for exporting notebooks as docx files.  
  
Out now on pip, [jupyterterminals](https://github.com/willkessler/jupyterterminals) is a notebook plugin extracted from the Jupyter Graffiti package that provides inline terminal shells along, with buttons to control them. Handy for courses where you want to wrap a terminal session with surrounding instructional material. _\[I'm thinking it could also be useful for tutorials, installation guides, and other technical documentation, etc.—Ed.\]_  
  
In chart land, the plotly folks have [released](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-jupyterdash-811f1f57c02e) **JupyterDash** \[[repo](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash)\] for building _Flask_ served _Dash_ apps from the full range of Jupyter environments. Hot reloading seems to be supported in JupyterLab, but not from traditional Jupyter notebooks. If jupyter-server-proxy is installed, it will be automatically detected and the dashboard application can be accessed through it.  
  
A handy community addition to the range of _ipywidgets_, [ipyscales](https://github.com/vidartf/ipyscales) provides a range of widgets for "front-end based scaling of array data  loaded datasets", as well as widgets for visualising color maps as color bars and for manually editing color maps.   
  
At the widget rendering implementation level, some of the folks over at Quansight seem to be of the opinion that with the _"many different rendering engines for Jupyter notebook outputs \[such as\] JupyterLab, nteract, voila, nbconvert, Jupyter sphinx, Colab, VS Code, ...,  if you have a custom way of rendering some widget (plotly, vega, etc), you maybe have to build integration for ALL of these separately! It's insane!"_ _\[puts me in mind of of at least one XKCD cartoon...—Ed.\]_. So they've started pitching some thoughts around the requirements for a _"cross-implementation MIME rendering thingy"_ _\[this is the sort of standards development language that could turn me on to standards development processes...—Ed.\]_ in the form of this **[jupyter-output-spec](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-output-spec)** discussion repo.  
  
Also display related, [repr\_utils](https://github.com/Luttik/repr_utils) is a handy little utility package that builds on IPython's object based rich display API offerings _\[things like IPython.display.HTML, etc.—Ed.\]_ with some lower (higher?) level display functions, such as _Header_, _Table_ and _List_.  
  
Via [StatTag](https://github.com/StatTag/StatTag),_"a free plug-in for conducting reproducible research and creating dynamic documents using Microsoft Word with the R, Stata and SAS statistical packages"_, I notice the pre-release, proof-of-concept ("only tested with .NET 4.5.1 on Windows") [jupyterkernelmanager](https://github.com/stattag/jupyterkernelmanager), _"a C# library that allows you to run locally installed Jupyter kernels and interact with them to execute code and return results"_. I'm guessing the idea is to support Jupyter kernel backed code execution in Word documents...  
  
With more and more Jupyter based environments out there, many with free plans, managing your files across them can be an issue if you aren't loyal to one and take what you can get when you can get it. The [jupyterlab\_gcsfilebrowser](https://github.com/gclouduniverse/jupyterlab_gcsfilebrowser) **JupyterLab Google Cloud Storage Integration** extension could help with this, providing _"a mechanism to browse and interact with Google Cloud Storage through the JupyterLab file browser"_. The stumbling block, though, comes in in setting up the authentication. _\[I wonder if there's any mileage in pondering trusted, hosted Jupyter Keychain service, with a keychain extension that you can easily install — and remove — from third party Jupyter servers, that lets you login once and then expose various secrets to other extensions that need access to them? —Ed.\]_  
  
In terms of file browsing UIs, [jupyter-elfinder](https://github.com/imjoy-team/jupyter-elfinder) provides a Jupyter server proxy wrapper for the [elfinder](https://github.com/Studio-42/elfinder) browser based file manager.  
  
In passing, a couple of other new-to-me JupyterLab extensions I spotted out there: [jupyterlab-system-monitor](https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlab-system-monitor), which provides an alternative frontend for to _nbresuse_ system metrics, such as memory and CPU usage; and [jupyterlab-execute-time](https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-execute-time), a JupyterLab equivalent to the notebook [execute\_time](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/execute_time) extension, for displaying cell execution times in a pretty way.  
  
And finally, and also new to me, [UpSet.js](https://upset.js.org/) is _"a JavaScript re-implementation of UpSetR which itself is based on UpSet to create interactive set visualizations for more than three sets"_. If you fancy using it in a notebook context, [upsetjs\_jupyter\_widget](https://github.com/upsetjs/upsetjs_jupyter_widget) pops an _ipywidget_ wrapper around it.
