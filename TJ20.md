Welcome to this twentieth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ20), so that'll be the first score up...  
  
It's not getting any easier though (hanging chads etc)! Rather than fall too far behind, this edition is largely a news catch-up. Topical reviews will hopefully make a return in the next issue _\[time allowing! —Ed.\]_.

News
----

The big news for many is likely to be that **JupyterLab** has been [released](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) at version 1.0, and as of this writing stands at v1.0.1...  
  
...and the **Binder Federation** has also had a [formal announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-international-binder-federation-4f6235c1537e) over on the official Jupyter blog.  
  
IPython went up to [v7.6](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/release-of-ipython-7-6/1511) (and then some) and Jupyter notebook is at RC1 for v6.0.0.  
  
The **JupyterLab Google Drive** extension also looks close to a v1.0 release with the [appearance](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-google-drive/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.0) of its RC1...  
  
... as the **Jupyter Enterprise Gateway** inches closer to v2.0 with its [RC2](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/tag/v2.0.0rc2) release, and the notebook Kernel Gateway (**nb2kg**) extension bumps up to [v](https://github.com/jupyter/nb2kg/releases/tag/v0.7.0)[0.7.0](https://github.com/jupyter/nb2kg/releases/tag/v0.7.0) with improved timeout and UTF-8 handling, by the looks of it.  
  
The **jupyterlab-sql** extension [bumped up](https://github.com/pbugnion/jupyterlab-sql/releases/tag/0.2.0) to v0.2.0 _\[and I note is now at 0.2.1...‚Ed.\]_ with support for a database explorer in which _"users can now see the tables in their database and click on a table to open it"_. If you prefer generating your SQL queries automatically, [PyPika](https://github.com/kayak/pypika) is a handy tool from Kayak that provides _"a SQL query builder with a pythonic syntax that doesn't limit the expressiveness of SQL"_.  
  
Some might consider this to be the spawn of the devil, others might see it as an intriguing stepping stone that might help lay a migration path from Excel to Jupyter by means of some sort of reverse proxy. _\[Whatever...—Ed..\]_ **nb2xls** is a **Jupyter notebooks to Excel Spreadsheets** [converter](https://github.com/ideonate/nb2xls) that allows you to export markdown, _pandas_ dataframes and _matplotlib_ charts into Excel, although input code cells are ignored. _\[In passing, I also noticed this [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lENBohWCvI8)...—Ed.\]_  
  
On the other hand, spreadsheet style widgets into Jupyter UIs maybe be the way to go? There are already things like _ipysheet_ and _qgrid_, although something like **[jexcel](https://github.com/paulhodel/jexcel)**, _\[which I don't think has a Jupyter wrapper yet? —Ed.\]_ perhaps shows how much further Javascript based spreadsheets can be pushed. _\[Of course, in Jupyter land, there's the possibility for JS spreadsheet UI and a Python etc computation backend... —Ed.\]_  
  
On the Microsoft Word front, the **[jupyter-docx-bundler](https://github.com/m-rossi/jupyter-docx-bundler)** moved up to v0.2.0 _\[I need to check the repo, but I'm guessing it's also now exploiting native pandoc handling of notebook ipynb as part of the conversion process?—Ed._\]. In the Jupyter discourse forum, there's also an announcement of a CalPoly [Microsoft Word Integration (Intern Project)](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/microsoft-word-integration-intern-project/1551), so if you comments or ideas on that front, consider chipping in to that thread...  
  
Microsoft themselves also seem to be highly supportive of notebooks in an open way. The latest related release seems to be [TensorWatch](https://github.com/microsoft/tensorwatch) ([about](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-makes-ai-debugging-and-visualization-tool-tensorwatch-open-source/)), a notebook embeddable _"debugging, monitoring and visualization \[tool\] for Python Machine Learning and Data Science"_ that includes lots of streaming chart goodness, too...  
  
Azure Data Studio now also has a [new extension](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/pull/6095) to _"show a tree view of Jupyter Book contents"_ _\[hmm... so how are they integrating Jupyter Books? And what about support from them to code execution backends (like, on an Azure backed Binderhub or kernel gateway backend?) —Ed.\]_.  
  
Uber also finally got round to [announcing](https://medium.com/vis-gl/introducing-kepler-gl-for-jupyter-f72d41659fbf) the release of [kepler.gl](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/tree/master/bindings/kepler.gl-jupyter) wrapped as a Jupyter Widget for all your interactive mapping needs. It supports pandas DataFrames and GeoPandas GeoDataFrames, so there's no reason not to give it a spin, is there?  
  
Meanwhile, Google did some stuff \[_I can't seem to find it in myself to generate any love for them on the Jupyter front, for some reason... —Ed.\]_: [deep learning containers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-deep-learning-containers-consistent-and-portable-environments) for use with Google Cloud AI PLatform Notebooks was one thing, analysing BigQuery data with Kaggle Kernels notebooks [another](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/analyze-bigquery-data-with-kaggle-kernels-notebooks?_lrsc=52de992b-7e25-4032-b68d-9ea2261a411f&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=elevate&utm_campaign=2017-17q3-gc-cc-abm-googlecloud-unpaidsocial-twitter-leadgen-elevate). One thing I do note is that lots of ML related notebook demos use Colab, rather than Binder, presumably because of the GPU support? _\[But your code, as is, won't necessarily run elsewhere? —Ed.\]_ This [demo](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify), for example, of _"a Deep Learning based project for colorizing and restoring old images (and video!)"_.  
  
Also from the Jupyter discourse forums, an MSc project team from UCL are [scoping](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/notebook-extension-for-dyslexic-and-visual-accessibility/1537) a notebook extension for **dyslexic and visual accessibility** and are soliciting feedback on their initial prototype. _\[Accessibility tools need a push, so things like this are worth supporting, not least to help explore the design space...—Ed.\] _  
  
With Voila making end-user developed, notebook powered, widgetised web apps a reality, the latest _ipywidgets_ release, supported by QuantStack, includes support for [templates for Jupyter widgets layouts](https://blog.jupyter.org/introducing-templates-for-jupyter-widget-layouts-f72bcb35a662). _\[By the by, I also notice that the author maintains [svgutils](https://svgutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a handy looking utility that lets you script publication quality multi-panel figures from SVG files exported from matplotlib. —Ed.\]_  
  
Kick-started by the recent South American Jupyter Workshop, it looks like a start has been made on translating some of the official Jupyter docs into [Spanish](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/issues/430). _\[Anyone know of other documentation translation initiatives out there? —Ed.\]_ In passing, I also spotted some notebooks for teaching mechanics — in [French](https://github.com/c-hebert/MecaDRIL)...  
  
A look at educational related Jupyter bits'n'bobs has been on my to-do list for ages, but it's not ready yet _\[not even really started yet, if truth be told... —Ed.\]_, so in the meantime, here's a [crib](https://github.com/jupyterhub/ltiauthenticator#moodle) for any Moodlers out there on running JupyterHub from **Moodle** using the LTI authenticator _\[disclosure: this was from a project I was involved, although the deployment/integration details were nothing to do with me...—Ed.\]_.  
  
The recent **GitLab** v12.0 release included [Git integration for JupyterHub](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/06/22/gitlab-12-0-released/#git-integration-for-jupyterhub); when deploying JupyterHub via GitLab’s Kubernetes integration, the JupyterLab Git extension will be automatically installed too _\[I think [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47138) is the issue where the integration was mooted/discussed? —Ed.\]_.  
  
Moments after the last issue of _Tracking Jupyter_ went out _\[or maybe even moments before...—Ed.\]_, **repo2docker** [support](https://blog.jupyter.org/binder-with-zenodo-af68ed6648a6) for Zenodo DOIs was [generalised](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/pull/704), with additional support being added in the first instance for _CaltechDATA_ DOIs.  
  
The BinderHub docs have also recently been [updated](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup-registry.html?highlight=azure%20container#set-up-azure-container-registry) with details of how to set up the Azure Container Registry for use with BinderHub deployments.  
  
Not strictly Jupyter, but Github recently [announced](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) support for **template repositories** (here's how you [create one](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-template-repository), and how you [create another repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) from one). Rather than creating a new repo as a fork of an old one, a template repository can be cloned into a new and arbitrarily named repository. _\[This is really handy for sharing repos intended to act as a boilerplate / bootstrap for another repository to build on top of. Like Binder base box repos...—Ed.\]_  
  
An example of a repo that might benefit from being templated _\[perhaps with a few tweaks to make the most of the templateness? —Ed.\]_ comes, via @betatim, in the form of [this](https://opendatazurich.github.io/zt-api/) Binderised repo from OpenDataZurich showing how to use the Zurich Tourism API... Or maybe [this](https://github.com/simonh10/nhs-notebooks/) repo for analysing NHS prescriptions ([about](https://towardsdatascience.com/saving-millions-for-the-nhs-with-pandas-338341fea340)).  
  
And finally, if you're looking for things to do in London on July 10th, the UCL Institute of Health Informatics Code Club are running a Code Club [event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ucl-ihi-code-club-launch-event-tickets-64423956789) that includes a Turing Way presentation in the form of _A how to guide for reproducible research_...

From the Twitterz
-----------------

Someone who does robotics [proclaimed](https://twitter.com/sushil_NASA/status/1142562991927250944): _"I strongly believe that Jupyter Notebook should be the 'default' for Deep Learning research papers with code. I am sure the research community is working on creating some standard templates as we have in Latex, MSWord today. This will fast pace AI research"_...  
  
...whilst a deep learning strategist [cautioned](https://twitter.com/mohammedri_/status/1142813053500755970): _"Jupyter notebooks promote poor programming practice that prevents high scalability"_.  
  
A data scientist and recovering evolutionary biologist [polyglotted](https://twitter.com/joedgallagher/status/1146130770383294464): _"\[m\]ost of our deployed code is Python and the team shares Jupyter Notebooks but a lot of visualisations are done using ggplot. I think being able to use both is for the best, more able to pick the best tool for the job!"_  
  
A mathematician [wondered](https://twitter.com/marcwouts/status/1142733120065720320): _"\[t\]oday I woke up with a crazy idea. What if we rewrite the history of a @ProjectJupyter notebook project and replace every .ipynb file with #Jupytext's Markdown representation?"_ _\[You can see a typical result [here](https://github.com/mwouts/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/jupytext_no_ipynb/README.md)...—Ed.\]_  
  
A maker of mappy and webby things [admitted](https://twitter.com/maptastik/status/1146135332359987200): "_once people start asking spatial questions, I'm either opening up Jupyter or loading Turf because I've not found WAB or PowerBI up to the task of answering spatial questions"_. _\[WTF is WAB? Digging back through the thread also made me wonder about AGOL... ArcGIS Online, me-now-thinks... And also reminds me: I'm still waiting to see a [turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) thing for notebooks...—Ed.\]_  
  
An aspiring data scientist, erm, aspired: _"\[i\]n the next few weeks, I plan to create a data analysis guide (using a Jupyter Notebook and Python) that helps people with the NFIP open data. My goal is to make everything reproducible and open source. The work will be uploaded to my GitHub" \[National Flood Insurance Program, perhaps??? Laudable goal, though...—Ed.\]_...  
  
...whilst a software architect [reflected](https://twitter.com/Tomcat_/status/1144224971243315200): "_\[h\]aving discussed theoretical digital tools for the #DigitalHumanities with @Dioneira last week, and now looking into #Jupyter notebooks for a big data project, I'm amazed to fall into the rabbit hole of what linguists and archeologists are already building in this area"_.  
  
And finally, someone interested in hydraulic civilisations, among other things, [asked someone else](https://twitter.com/KWittfogel/status/1145373378951483393): _"are you aware of any resources that can guide one on how to build a data infrastructure from scratch? How to warehouse data, assimilate old data into a new DBMS, incorporate jupyter into analysts’ workflow, etc? Any suggestions on where to start are welcomed"_ _\[which made me wonder: are the big consulting firms consulting on Jupyter deployments yet? —Ed.\]_

Auth & Enterprise User Management
---------------------------------

In passing, I spotted a [new](https://github.com/gher-ulg/jupyterhub-webdavauthenticator) **webdav** authenticator for JupyterHub and some updates to [this](https://github.com/cwaldbieser/jhub_cas_authenticator) JupyterHub CAS 3.0 authenticator. The latter also comes with a [Vagrant test environment](https://github.com/cwaldbieser/vagrant_jhub_cas_test_env), which I thought was interesting...  
  
A few weeks ago, in [another context](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/04/24/creating-team-and-individual-wordpress-blogs-from-your-vle-via-an-lti-wordpress-plugin/), I came across a Wordpress plugin for creating multi-user sites via an LTI plugin. This is probably nothing like that, although it feels similar-ish to me because of the way it presumably supports multi-user deployment _\[I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, you realise...—Ed.\]_: a Jupyter Spawner [pre\_spawn hook](https://github.com/rasmunk/ldap_hooks) for submitting/creating an LDAP entry before the spawner starts a notebook.

Pulling Privately...
--------------------

Not so much a review of what's available / possible, perhaps,  as what currently isn't when it comes to pulling from private repos, particularly in publicly launched contexts.

*   some [discussion](https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/issues/53#issuecomment-430587980) around _nbgitpuller_ around support pulling from a private repo;
*   some [docs](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup-binderhub.html#accessing-private-repositories) on how to access private repos from _BinderHub_ launched environments;
*   sone _Zero-to-JupyterHub_ [docs](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#hub-imagepullsecret) on creating an _"image pull secret"_ that allows you to pull images from private image registries;
*   some [notes](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/596) on secret management options for a public hub defining repository.

Dashboards and Data Explorer Tools
----------------------------------

Following on from the round-up of plotting frameworks in #TJ19, here's a summary of some graphical interactive data explorers and dashboard creation tools.  
  
Voila (#TJ19) looks like it has traction, and the grid layout templates in the latest _ipywidgets_ release will likely improve the design of widgetised apps delivered using it, but it's perhaps also worth noting other possible approaches _\[even if they do appear to have stalled!—Ed.\]_ to keep in mind what the range of dashboarding opportunities and possibilities are _\[or used to be!—Ed.\]_.  
  
For example, [Flexx](https://github.com/flexxui/flexx) _"is a pure Python toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI's), that uses web technology for its rendering. Apps are written purely in Python \[and a\] PScript transpiler generates the necessary JavaScript on the fly"_. Flexx apps can be _"__used interactively from the Jupyter notebook__"_ but [at the moment](https://flexx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/running.html?highlight=jupyter#flexx-in-jupyter) this looks like it means you can run the app view within a notebook (JupyterLab is not currently supported), rather than write the application within a notebook and then serve it as a Flexx app (or perhaps even via a Jupyter application server).  
  
An early JupyterLab extension, [jupyterlab\_voyager](https://github.com/altair-viz/jupyterlab_voyager), demonstrated how to embed the [Vega Voyager2](https://github.com/vega/voyager#voyager-2) tool in a Jupyter environment, but as attention _\[and support? —Ed.\]_ drifts away from older tools, fresher upstarts built on a more recent code-base basis are starting to pop-up a bit more. The [nteract dx](https://github.com/nteract/dx) Data Explorer for Python looks like it provides an interactive table that can toggle into chart views. At a lower level, the [jupyterlab-floatview](https://github.com/denphi/jupyterlab-floatview) extension provides a couple of widgets: a _floatview widget_, which can be used as a context manager like _ipywidgets_' output widget; and a _glue manager widget_ which can be used as a data/visualization manager for a [glue](http://docs.glueviz.org/en/stable/) dataset. _\[Hmm... Glue... What's that then? —Ed.\]_  
  
Glue, it seems, is _"a Python library to explore relationships within and among datasets"_ whose _"main interface until now has been based on Qt"_; a _"highly experimental"_ Jupyter extension, [glue-jupyter](https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-jupyter), _'\[s\]ometimes known as "Glupyter"'_ apparently_ \[i.e. never known as Glupyter... —Ed.\]_ also _"aims to provide a way to use Glue in Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter lab instead"_.  
  
_For the code archaeologists, [Gleam](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gleam) was a tool for "creating interactive visualizations with Python" that appears to have stalled at least five years ago..._  
  
Another data analysis and reporting tool, Kayak's [fireant](https://github.com/kayak/fireant) \[[docs](https://fireant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\] is a _"data analysis tool for quickly building charts, tables, reports, and dashboards \[that\]__ defines a schema for configuring metrics and dimensions which removes most of the leg work of writing queries and formatting charts"_. A key concept in the framework appears to be a _Data __Set:_

> _"a representation of a data set ... used to execute queries and transform result sets into widgets such as charts or tables. A Data Set requires only a couple of definitions in order to use: A database connector, a database table, join tables, and dimensions and metrics. Metrics and Dimension definitions tell fireant how to query and use data in widgets. Once a slicer is created, it's query API can be used to build queries with just a few lines of code selecting which dimensions and metrics to use and how to filter the data"_.

There isn't an obvious quick start demo though, although the _fireant_ repo does seem to build okay when the repo is launched using MyBinder.  
  
One of the growth areas for data visualisations appears to be in machine learning, where it makes sense to get a feel for the data before your start to torture it by eyeballing the data distributions. A good example is the [_facets_ project](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets), which _"contains two visualizations for understanding and analyzing machine learning datasets: Facets Overview and Facets Dive":_

*   Overview _"gives a high-level view of one or more data sets produc\[ing\] a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis \[that\] can also be used to compare statistics across two or more data sets (both numeric and string features, including multiple instances of a number or string per feature)"_;
*   Dive _"is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of multidimensional data points, allowing users to seamlessly switch between a high-level overview and low-level details"_, with the claim that it's good for for _"spot\[ting\] patterns and outliers in complex data sets"_.

And finally, if Bayesian models are your thing, [arviz](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz) provides a set of graphical tools for exploring them. Read more on JOSS as: Kumar et al., (2019). _ArviZ a unified library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models in Python_. Journal of Open Source Software, 4(33), 1143, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01143 .
