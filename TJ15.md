Tracking Jupyter Newsletter, the Fifteenth...
=============================================

by Tony Hirst

Welcome to this fifteenth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ15).  
  
The two weeks became three... what can I say... Whenever...  
  
There's also the downside... this is a looooong newsletter, double the length, and double the price too... which means it's still free, but the investment is in time (yours, as well as mine...). _\[It may be better to treat this as a long weekend read, rather than a newsletter...—Ed.\]_  
 

News
----

JupyterHub has also made it to [v1.0 beta](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#id1) _\[yeah :-) —Ed.\]_ with a discourse comment thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyterhub-1-0-beta/616) for feedback. Release note highlights include: _support TLS encryption and authentication of all internal communication; there is full UI support for managing named servers (each JupyterHub user may have access to more than one named server), a configuration limit on the number of named servers each user can have, and an option to trigger shutdown of a user’s servers when they log out; custom spawners, authenticators, and proxies may now register themselves via ‘entry points’; for testing, SimpleSpawner and DummyAuthenticator, are now part of JupyterHub; and there's a health check endpoint at /hub/health._  
  
There have also been some more **security updates** released, with JupyterHub  ≤ 0.9.4 and Jupyter Notebook ≤ 5.7.6 being affected. Versions 0.9.5 and 5.7.7 were [released](https://blog.jupyter.org/open-redirect-vulnerability-in-jupyter-jupyterhub-adf43583f1e4) with fixes but it's also worth checking that there haven't been more updates since.  
  
In the last newsletter, I forgot to mention that [v. 2.3.0 of the Jupyter Kernel Gateway](https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/releases/tag/2.3.0) had been released. There's also a new [slidedeck](https://www.slideshare.net/luckbr1975/strata-scaling-jupyter-with-jupyter-enterprise-gateway) out, as presented at the recent _Strata Data SF_ conference, on _Scaling interactive workloads across kubernetes cluster_with the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway (it gets relevant from about slide 14 onwards). As you'll no doubt recall this is a "_follow-on project to Jupyter Kernel Gateway with additional abilities to support remote kernel sessions on behalf of multiple users within resource managed frameworks such as Apache Hadoop YARN or Kubernetes". \[?! I really need to get my head round how this pieces are supposed to fit together!__— Ed.\] _Here's a partial refresher: [On-demand Notebooks with JupyterHub, Jupyter Enterprise Gateway and Kubernetes](https://blog.jupyter.org/on-demand-notebooks-with-jupyterhub-jupyter-enterprise-gateway-and-kubernetes-e8e423695cbf) _\[I am still none the wiser... nb2kg is also one of the pieces, right?! —Ed.\]_  
  
Several years, a **Long Now Foundation** seminar — [Drew Endy, _The iGEM Revolution_](http://longnow.org/seminars/02014/sep/16/igem-revolution/) — introduced me to the idea of _BioBricks_, _"man-made DNA sequences encoding elementary modules that may be combined to produce more complex synthetic biological systems"_. Like Lego, for DNA. So just imagine if you could design a bit of DNA in a notebook and then use some magic to bioprint it... Erm... [Engineering Proteins in the Cloud with Python and Transcriptic, or, How to Make Any Protein You Want for $360](http://blog.booleanbiotech.com/genetic_engineering_pipeline_python.html). In passing, I also noticed [NanoDJ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/586842v1), _"a dockerized Jupyter notebook for interactive Oxford Nanopore MinION sequence manipulation and genome gssembly"_ that integrates _"tools for simplified manipulation and assembly of DNA sequences produced by ONT devices"_ \[[repo](https://github.com/genomicsITER/NanoDJ)\].  
  
I guess everyone knows about Google Colab _\[and I guess folk have different opinions about it...—Ed.\]_ but for an authentic Jupyterlab experience on Google servers, their new [**Google Cloud AI Platform Notebooks**​](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/notebooks/) service provides a Google maintained virtual machine you can run the Google Cloud (using servers with or without GPU acceleration). The core JupyterLab environment is extended with some preinstalled extensions: [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git), [jupyterlab-tensorboard](https://github.com/chaoleili/jupyterlab_tensorboard) and, interestingly, [nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime), the notebook differ service _\[by the by, I just spotted this [nbdime tutorial](https://github.com/DaanVanHauwermeiren/nbdime-tutorial), but not had aa chance to work through it yet... —Ed.\]_. You can read more about setting it up and working with it [here](https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-google-cloud-ai-platform-notebooks-as-a-web-based-python-ide-e729e0dc6eed); for a more FAQ style set of notes, see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-jupyter-on-a-google-cloud-vm-5ba1b473f4c2).  
  
Over in IBM land, it seems that [Watson Studio Desktop is now free for academia](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/watson-studio-desktop-is-now-free-for-academia-f8b50a118370). _\[As an educator, should we "buy in" to free services like this, Azure Notebooks, etc etc..? —Ed.\]_  
  
I don't know if this _is_ news _\[I tend to post them as I find them...—Ed.\]_ but environmental data researchers have access to [Jupyter notebooks via the **EU WEkEO** service](https://www.wekeo.eu/documentation/using_jupyter_notebooks). Users of the EGI Cloud service also have access to [Jupyter on the EGI cloud service](https://notebooks.egi.eu/hub/login). If you want to know more, here's a [wiki page](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_Notebooks), or perhaps this post on [**EGI Notebooks** for interactive analysis of data using EGI storage and compute services](https://www.eosc-hub.eu/training-event/egi-notebooks-interactive-analysis-data-using-egi-storage-and-compute-services) may help. \[Apparently, _EGI is a federated e-Infrastructure set up to provide advanced computing services for research and innovation. The EGI e-infrastructure is publicly-funded and comprises hundreds of data centres and cloud providers spread across Europe and worldwide. The EGI Cloud provides compute for national e-infrastructures and European Intergovernmental Research Organisations (EIROs)._\] If you live down under, then maybe you should look at the notebook providing **[Tinker Studio](https://tinker.edu.au/tools/tinker-studio/)**, which forms part of national research infrastructure supporting Australian researchers in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS).  
  
If you want to look a bit into the detail of _that_ **black hole picture**, @betatim checked, and the [code repo](https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging) runs on MyBinder...  
  
And finally, [a tweet](https://twitter.com/alexstaravoitau/status/1111679214879760384) from Alex Staravoitau /‏ @alexstaravoitau developer of the [**Juno** Jupyter client for iPad](https://navoshta.com/juno/): 

> I'm pleased to announce that from now on I will be donating 10% of all @junoclient sales proceeds to @ProjectJupyter. I highly admire their work, and hope that this (small) contribution will nevertheless prove valuable to Jupyter community!

 

Events
------

This event will be in the past by the time this newsletter is released, but it's worth remarking on, I think _\[hopefully materials  / video will be shared? —Ed.\]_: UC Berkeley's **[Graduate Student Introduction to Data Science Pedagogy](https://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/datasci/?event_ID=122874)**, on April 11, 2019. It promisesd _instruction for graduate students about using the data science teaching tools such as developing Jupyter notebooks for classes and teaching on a cloud based JupyterHub. Examples of how to support data science teaching in all types of classes_. What's more, it was also advertised with a _No previous experience necessary, all disciplines encouraged_ invitation. _\[There are many ways to use notebooks, I think, and each is different from the other: using notebooks for teaching and learning, for example, compared to using notebooks for exploratory data analysis, for exploratory programming, or as part of a research publication workflow. —Ed.\]_  
  
Coming up in the next couple of weeks, the next remote access enabled Jupyter Community Call will be on Tuesday, April 30th, 2019 at 9am PST; check [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/all-jupyter-community-calls/668) for the latest details.  
  
Attendees of the Collaborative Conference on Computational and Data Intensive Science 2019 (**C3DIS 2019**), to be held the week of 6 – 10 May at the National Convention Centre, Canberra, have a wide range of Jupyter related pre- and post- conference workshops to choose from. These include: _Pangeo: Scalable Geoscience Tools in Python — Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter_; an _Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks – for Research Support Specialists_;and _Advanced Use of Jupyter Notebooks – Working with Open Geoscience Data_. Check out the [workskops program](http://http://www.c3dis.com/workshop-program) for more details.  
  
If visualising **biological data analysis** is your thing, UC Davis are hosting a_“Speeding Up Science” in Environmental -Omics_ hackathon onMay 8-10, 2019. It's intended to pull together a set of reproducible Jupyter/Binder workflows for _"creating visualisations that are commonly published in scientific journal articles (heatmaps, read/OTU summaries, etc.)"_. Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZ2BsSYzPu1FqbQ4-zYvkKBXEO6nhJyFlNOi7A6TfUM/edit). _\[I'm going to try to do a round up of some bio related vis tools in the next issue of Tracking Jupyter... It's been parked for months... —Ed.\]_  
  
And if hacking around with the **Jupyter kernel protocol** appeals to you, the Jupyter Community Workshop on [Building upon the Jupyter Kernel Protocol](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshop-building-upon-the-jupyter-kernel-protocol-2409409ed7ec) will be held in Paris, France, from May 27-29, 2019, at Capital Fund Management (CFM), in the heart of Paris. _\[I also hope to be doing a round-up some kernel hacking related items in the next issue of Tracking Jupyter...—Ed.\]_  
  
In the UK, [**Python for Researchers**](http://www.pythonforresearchers.com/) run various one day workshops for postgraduate students and researchers that includes hands-on experience of Jupyter notebooks. The next workshop seems to be in Liverpool on Saturday, 6 July 2019.  
 

Things to Watch
---------------

I general prefer podcasts to videos (I can listen to them on driving commutes) but video has its place and the audio stream often gives you most of what you need, so you can use it as radio. So here are a couple of videos that I've come across recently that may be worth having on in the background if nothing else _\[that's not meant to disparage the following video creators or denigrate the videos! More a comment on my own practice... —Ed.\]_  
  
For what looks like a synoptic overview, [The Modern Lab Notebook: Scientific computing with Jupyter and Python](https://statusq.org/archives/2019/04/11/8946/) provides a two hour smorgasboard of the tools and packages that make up a contemporary, computationally backed, research work environment. _\[It's not just a Trojan horse for more coffee...! ;-) —Ed.\]_  
  
If you want a video overview of the Google Cloud AI notebooks, this recent presentation from Cloud Next '19, Google's cloud developer conference, should tell you all you need to know: [Jupyter Notebook-Centric Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU_xdogXFeE).  
  
A bit niche possibly _\[possibly?! —Ed.\]_ but this video tutorial is a _weak signal_ if you track such things: [Subsurface Modeling Course: Declustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9VbyqafnPk). Out there, in the wild, and by the by, using a Jupyter RISE slideshow to deliver the visuals...  
 

Showcasing...
-------------

To a certain extent, the robotics community haven't been very well served to dat by Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab _\[my first attempt was a [notebook to VREP simulator hook-up](https://github.com/psychemedia/ou-robotics-vrep/tree/master/robotVM)... —Ed.\]_ but as widget development improves and familiarity with things like WebRTC support ([#TJ8](https://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter/letters/tracking-jupyter-newsletter-the-eighth)) improves, this may well change. In terms of widgets, the [RoboStack/jupyter-ros](https://github.com/RoboStack/jupyter-ros)_Jupyter widget helpers for ROS, the Robot Operating System_ look interesting... There's a recent [write-up](https://blog.jupyter.org/ros-jupyter-b7e82b5e1202) on the official Jupyter blog if you want to know more.  
  
Word is slowly trickling out about the **Jupyter Book** publishing framework _\[I still need to try it out properly myself...—Ed.\]._ There's a nice example of [jupyter-book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html) powered interactive exercise book for the [Modeling and Simulation](https://joergbrech.github.io/Modellbildung-und-Simulation/intro) course at the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg; and here's another on [Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining for Heliophysics](https://helioml.github.io/HelioML/title.html). For an overview, see this [intro](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html).  
  
Via a tweet, _jupyter-book_ lead @choldgraf shared this related workflow around the DS _\[Data Science, presumably...?! —Ed.\]_ courses at Berkeley: 

> *   Write all course content (textbook, homeworks, labs) in [@ProjectJupyter](https://twitter.com/ProjectJupyter) notebooks on [@github](https://twitter.com/github)
> *   Use jupyter-book + gh-pages to host the book online ([http://inferentialthinking.com ](https://t.co/ifmM8CO935 "http://inferentialthinking.com"))
> *   Use in-page links to a JupyterHub for coding sessions

Chris' recent presentation from the aforementioned Strata Conference can be found here: [Jupyter Book: Interactive books running in the cloud](https://speakerdeck.com/choldgraf/jupyter-book-interactive-books-running-in-the-cloud).  
  
If Jupyter Books are too heavyweight for you, the lighter weight **[nbreport](https://github.com/choldgraf/nbreport)** HTML-report-from Jupyter-notebook generator may be more to your liking. It creates a single, standaloneHTML file, topped with author / title information, and with all empty or hidden-tagged cells, error outputs and code cell input and output numbers removed.  
  
If neither of those suit, **[ipypublish](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish)** is a_.tex_, _.pdf_ and _.html _generating **nbconvert** extension_ for creating and editing publication ready scientific reports and presentation, from one or more Jupyter Notebooks_. Citations are also supported...  
  
_\[Cribbing from "R-down" publication workflows, I guess poster generation is next? Here's a possible crib: [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown). —Ed.\]_  
  
Of course, it may turn out that a commercially hosted notebook mediated publishing environments are the way to go? Something line **[Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/)**, for example? As with many services of this ilk, there's a free, resource limited plan if you work in the open. In the case of _Nextjournal_, the upsell is to a $99 researcher/month _\[individually targeted? —Ed.\]_ plan (_"private notebooks/data access, secrets management, one concurrent compute resource including GPU, unlimited private collaborators"_) and then a $149 researcher/month _\[institutionally directed? —Ed.\]_ plan (_"starts at 5 seats, SAML single sign-on, priority support, self-hosted or cloud-hosted, invoice billing"_).  
  
If you want to push your thinking around interactive reports a little bit further _\[and you keep wondering what happened to [Tangle.js](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/)... —Ed.\]_ why not check out these Bret Victor inspired [Explorable Multiverse Analyses](https://explorablemultiverse.github.io/) _\[in an animated document view, click on the document links and keep an eye on the document figures / text...—Ed.\]_.   
  
PS speaking of tangle, by chance, here's another mention of it in  [Let your data tell the story](https://www.quansight.com/single-post/2019/03/14/Let-your-data-tell-the-story): _"Tangle demo coming soon"_. _\[OMFG....—Ed.\]_  
 

Hosted Notebook Environments
----------------------------

With most self-proclaimed "data science" services on the web offering notebooks as a first class UI (see [#TJ14](https://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter/letters/tracking-jupyter-newsletter-the-fourteenth) for various examples), it can be hard to know where to advise folk to go if they just want to get started with a notebook environment. A widely shared recent post on **[Six easy ways to run your Jupyter Notebook in the cloud](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/)** provides a review of six _\[that's not a spoiler; the clue was in the title.. —Ed.\]_ online free (or free plan) hosted notebook services: _Binder_ _\[for reference, it's always worth checking out any [alternative open Binder deployments](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/known-deployments.html?highlight=deployments) if MyBinder is down... —Ed.\]_, _Kaggle Kernels_, _Google Colaboratory (Colab)_, _Microsoft Azure Notebooks_, _CoCalc_ _\[once know as SageMathCloud, for those of you with a long memory... —Ed.\]_ and _Datalore_.   
  
The comparison criteria provide a great starting point for what could become a more widely supported _\[perhaps wikified? —Ed.\]_ comparison matrix. For example, here's an off-the-top-of-my-head way of grouping the criteria:

*   _"Generality"_: Supported languages, Ease of working with datasets;
*   _"Standardisation"_: Interface similarity, Keyboard shortcuts, Missing features, Added features, 
*   _"Constraints"_: Ability to install packages, Internet access;
*   _"Sociability"_: Ability to work privately, Ability to share publicly, Ability to collaborate;
*   _"Costs"_: Performance of the free plan, Ability to upgrade for better performance, Documentation and technical support.

_\[The care and attention in that post puts my sketchy [More Than Ten Free Hosted Jupyter Notebook Environments You Can Try Right Now](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/01/04/more-than-ten-free-hosted-jupyter-notebook-environments-you-can-try-right-now/) placeholder post from the start of this year to shame...! Always too many other things for me to do, to do anything properly! —Ed.\]_   
 

Productivity Tools, Hacks 'n' Extensions
----------------------------------------

**Testing notebooks** effectively is still one of the things I haven't cracked. A colleague of mine is looking at Selenium testing of notebooks, which could be handy particular where widgets are involved _\[this is distinct from [using notebooks for Selenium based testing or video tutorial creation.](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/01/21/using-selenium-to-support-teaching/)..—Ed.\]_; but there are also a couple of new command line testing tools I noticed to add to things like the [nbval](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) py.test framework plugin ([#TJ11](https://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter/letters/tracking-jupyter-newsletter-the-eleventh)): [nbsmoke](https://github.com/pyviz/nbsmoke), a tool for running basic notebook checks (_"Do they run? Do they contain lint?"_) ; and [treon](https://github.com/ReviewNB/treon), that will run unittests and docstests that are defined in a notebook.  
  
_\[I'm still looking for effective workflows and examples of how to set up continuous integration tests around such things... —Ed.\]_ If you have any insights on testing, or example workflows to share, there's a [relevant _"notebook testing"_ thread](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/testing-notebooks/701) on the discourse site.  
  
[xml2jupyter](https://github.com/rheiland/xml2jupyter) is a simple package for visually editing / **setting parameter files** in an XML configuration file, with a write-ip on _bioRxiv_: [xml2jupyter: Mapping parameters between XML and Jupyter widgets](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601211v1). _\[I wonder: could an XML config file be "dualled" with a widgetised notebook, a bit like Jupytext md/py-ipynb duals? —Ed.\]_  
  
If you find you keep losing track of where a function you're using in a JupyterLab notebook is defined, you may find the [jupyterlab-go-to-definition](http://https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-go-to-definition) extension handy: a shortcut will let you _jump to the definition of a variable or function in JupyterLab notebook and file editor_.  
  
**PyCharm** recently added improved notebook support to its enterprise edition. If you want to know a little bit of what went on behind the scenes, this interview with their lead Jupyter developer revealing [How We Did the New Jupyter Support](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2019/04/how-we-did-the-new-jupyter-support-interview-with-anton-bragin/) may appeal... In operation, it sounds a little similar to how _Jupytext_ duals notebook and text (py, or md) files but without the need for a paired text file:

> \[A\] single notebook IPYNB file ... is constantly updating from changes in the source code editor and outputs of code execution, and can be opened in the original Jupyter without any additional manipulation. There are no exports, no separate Python files to sync with the original notebook, etc. Extracting the code into a separate editor allowed us to bring most of the PyCharm functionality into the notebook world, including code completion, inspections, type checking and more. So now it’s much easier to make your code shine.

**RStudio Connect** has [introduced](http://https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/03/22/announcing-rstudio-connect-1-7-2/) _"support for publishing Jupyter Notebooks as well as Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, and plumber APIs that combine R and Python"_ along with an [rsconnect-jupyter](https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect-jupyter) notebook extension that lets you publishing notebooks directly to RStudio Connect.  
 

...and Accessibility Too
------------------------

As well as making our work environments productive, they need to be accessible too. This is particularly true in educational use cases, where accessibility is a legal requirement. If you're working in education, and you've made accessibility improvements to your Jupyter environments, or you have style guides / style sheets / themes for improving accessibility, or even just rules of thumb, please share them into the community. For example, [Accessibility of Jupyter for Impaired Individuals](https://colbrydi.github.io/accessibility-of-jupyter-for-impaired-individuals.html).  
  
Twitter is one way of sharing #jupyter #a11y practice too. For example, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/d3f0/status/1111520142096285697):

> I just realized that the your browser’s TextToSpeech API is available in your #Jupyter #Cells with the JS magic :D You can make your notebook speak to you, “Hey, I’ve finished” when some long running task has completed. You need to run the whole nb tho, and put it at the end  
>   
> %%javascript  
> speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Have you subscribed to Tracking Jupyter yet?"))

  
Loosely related, but not strictly Jupyter, I noticed this coming out of the House of Commons Library: [Developing a vibrant accessible colour palette](https://olihawkins.com/2019/04/1).  
 

Feeling Tense About TPU Co-processors?
--------------------------------------

If you were tempted by the mention of **TPU** co-processors in [#TJ13](https://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter/letters/tracking-jupyter-newsletter-the-thirteenth), but aren't sure where to start, here's a recipe for using Jupyter notebooks with your [#Edge-TPU: Coral USB Accelerator + rPI + Docker](https://lemariva.com/blog/2019/03/edge-tpu-coral-usb-accelerator-rpi-docker) that lets you test the performance of the Coral USB accelerator Edge-TPU on a **Raspberry Pi3** using self-contained a Docker image. The example seems to stream an image from the PI camera and then classify it using a TensorFlow model running on the TPU.  
 

Visualising Graphs
------------------

_\[As promised.. Also note that it's **graphs**, not charts...__ —Ed.\]_  
  
Personally, I'm a **_Gephi_** fan, and I've never really found a notebook based graph viewer that I get on with, or gives me the control over laying out large graphs that Gephi does. _\[But who knows what the [future of Gephi](https://gephi.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/is-gephi-obsolete-situation-and-perspectives/) holds... Ed.\]_  
  
However, there a some tools that do an okay job, so here's a quick round-up of some of the ones that I'm aware of, the ropey _\[or at least, broken/not-so-good...—Ed.\]_ as well as the good...  
  
To start with, let's see what we can do with some help from an old stalwart commandline application if you have it installed: **Graphviz**. The Python [graphviz](https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz) package provides a simple Python interface for Graphviz that plays nicely with Jupyer notebooks ([review](https://h1ros.github.io/posts/introduction-to-graphviz-in-jupyter-notebook/)). If you want to create animated _Graphviz_ diagrams from a series of separate frames, the [GraphvizAnim](https://github.com/mapio/GraphvizAnim) package should help.  
  
You can also use notebooks to [visualise CNTK models with Graphviz and D3 in F#](https://areslazarus.com/archive/cntk-1025-visualizing-cntk-models-with-graphviz-and-d3-in-f-for-jupyter/), apparently _\[I can parse very little of that sentence, or the post it links to... —Ed.\]_.  
  
They're not the most elaborate graphs, but the **[BlockDiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/)** diagram generators work in notebook and make it easy to create a range of diagrams, including simple block and arrow diagrams. There's also a custom package for generating [Hasse Diagrams](https://pyhasse.org/pages/notebooks/pyhasse-core/nb-hassediagram-2d/), _\["__a type of mathematical diagram used to represent a finite partially ordered set, in the form of a drawing of its transitive reduction" apparently, at least according to Wikipedia... —Ed.\]_.  
  
There are several examples of packages that have attempted to embed sigma.js widgets in a notebook, though many of them appear to be deprecated:[ koorukuroo/pynetviz](https://github.com/koorukuroo/pynetviz) doesn't render anything in MyBinder notebooks, but the [paulgb/nbgraph](https://github.com/paulgb/nbgraph) _interact_ and _networkx_ demos do work in MyBinder if you install _networkx_. _\[The igraph demo, which perhaps now refers to jgraph, doesn't seem to work. The [jgraph](https://github.com/patrickfuller/jgraph) package will also not install from it's own repo. —Ed.\] _As far as sketchy demo notebook recipes of generating _sigma.js_ graphs goes, there's one [here](https://github.com/jacobstallone/SIGMA-JS-IN-JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK-AND-NETWORK-SCIENCE)_\[you'll need to install pandas to get it to run on MyBinder...—Ed.\]_  The [ipysigma](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/ipysigma) package, as described in this JupyterCon 2017 presentation — [Beautiful networks and network analytics made simpler with Jupyter](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny-2017/public/schedule/detail/59874) ([video](https://pyvideo.org/jupytercon-2017/beautiful-networks-and-network-analytics-made-simpler-with-jupyter-daina-bouquin-john-deblase.html)) — seems to be the most recently maintained package, and the demos appear to work in MyBinder.  
  
Python's **_networkx_** graph analysis package provides plotting support for graphs within notebooks using matplotlib. You can see examples by running the notebooks in the [networkx/notebooks](https://github.com/networkx/notebooks) repository via MyBinder. _\[This has a requirement on another Python Graphviz wrapper, [pygraphviz](https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz), that itself has a dependency on the libgraphviz-dev Linux package. —Ed.\]_ There's a basic _networkx_ demo for working with _d3.js_ [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-visualise-the-global-exporting-network-using-networkx-and-d3-b85abee95ee2) and more polished demos for using it with established plotting packages such as _plotly_ [here](https://plot.ly/python/network-graphs/) and _bokeh_ [here](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/graph.html)... If you want to plot networks on an interactive map, here's a [demo](https://github.com/sfsheath/folium-network/blob/master/folium-network.ipynb) of rendering a _networkx_ network on a map using _folium_. _\[I'm noticing Github notebook previews are really sucky atm, so I'm spending much more time viewing them via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)... —Ed.\]_  
  
In terms of things pitched as "network visualisation" packages that play nicely with notebooks, [pyvis](https://github.com/WestHealth/pyvis) could be an interesting candidate, although it's lite on notebook demos at the moment...  
  
However, this looks like it's far more useful: **[nxviz](https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz)**, _"a graph visualization package for NetworkX \[for\] creat\[ing\] beautiful graph visualizations \[via\] a declarative API"_. You can see it in action in this great Jupyter notebook RISE slideshow tutorial resource by the developer of that package: [Network Analysis Made Simple](http://https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple) _\[this is just brilliant... —Ed.\]_  
  
As well as _networkx_ _\[which is my goto Python network/graph package... —Ed. \]_, it looks like there's another 'large network' capable package out there in the form of **[_NetworKit_](https://networkit.github.io/)** \[[repo](https://github.com/kit-parco/networkit)\]. This seems to be an "open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis" with the aim of "provid\[ing\] tools for the analysis of large networks in the size range from thousands to billions of edges ...\[by\] implement\[ing\] efficient graph algorithms, many of them parallel to utilize multicore architectures". _\[Apparently. The blurb also claims that "u__sing NetworKit is as simple as importing the networkit Python package", but I couldn't get it to install. First it wanted cmake, then it... I dunno... —Ed.\]_  
  
(For users of online commercial cloud based graph services, there's [PyGraphistry](http://github.com/graphistry/pygraphistry) for _Graphistry_ users. In the archive, more or less, is [PyLinkurious](https://github.com/Linkurious/PyLinkurious).)  
  
And finally, network based visualisations seem to be a Big Thing in the biosciences, so here are a couple of tools from that area...  
  
**[_visJS2jupyter_](https://github.com/ucsd-ccbb/visJS2jupyter)** looks, at least from the publications associated with it  —_ [Interactive network visualization in Jupyter notebooks: visJS2jupyter](http://compbio.ucsd.edu/bringing-interactivity-network-visualization-jupyter-notebooks-visjs2jupyter/), Bioinformatics, 34 (1), 2018, pp126–128_, for example, or this [blog post](http://compbio.ucsd.edu/bringing-interactivity-network-visualization-jupyter-notebooks-visjs2jupyter/) — to provide a range of tools for visualising networks particularly within a  bioinformatics context. But I've never had much success getting it to work properly, running into Py2 vs Py 3 issues, problems rendering output graphs, etc. _\[At the last attempt, it doesn't render graphs for me in MyBinder, even with the required Python packages installed (pandas, networkx, mygene). There are also some errors in the notebooks that get in the way of running the notebooks, like legacy Py2 print statements... —Ed.\]_  
  
Binderising the repo could really help here, as it provides a quick way for package maintainers to check that everything is running at least as far as demos go, even if their package does not include tests. It also means that if the repo includes a set of notebook demos / examples, they can serve as _de facto_ tests and "How to Use This Package" docs that can be used by anyone.  
  
According to [other blurb](https://py2cytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), **Cytoscape** is _"a de-facto standard desktop application for network visualization in the bioinformatics community"_ that seems to [date back](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/11/2498.full) to the dark ages (or at least, 2003). The [project home page](https://cytoscape.org/) is also a little more circumspect, presenting Cytoscape as _"__an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating these with any type of attribute data"_. You can try it out by opening the examples folder of the [jupyter-cytoscape](https://github.com/cytoscape/jupyter-cytoscape) repo in MyBinder. \[In that example, cytoscape seems to create a canvas from one cell then write into it from other cells. Which feels like a JupyterLab tear of sort of thing... —Ed.\]  
  
As befits its longevity, _Cytoscape_ certainly seems to feed an ecosystem of its own, too: [py2cytoscape](https://py2cytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) \[[repo](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/Python)\], home of the grandiose claim, provides a collection of Python utilities for working with _Cytoscape_ and _Cytoscape.js_; it also offers a range of converters for moving between _Cytoscape.js_ JSON ("one of the standard data exchange formats in the _Cytoscape_ community") with two way conversion between _networkx_ and _igraph_ objects, as well as from _pandas_ DataFrames to Cytoscape.js JSON. The **[Cytoscape Jupyter Widget](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-jupyter-widget)** (aka _CyJupyter_) provides a _Cytoscape.js_ based network visualizer for Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab, supporting visualisation of data in the Cytoscape eXchange format (_.cx_) as well as _Cytoscape.js_ JSON (_.cyjs_). _Cytoscape_ also looks like something you can play with it too _\[always good in my book... —Ed.\]_, as this post describing how to [\[d\]raw \[a\] molecular network \[in a\] Jupyter notebook with RDKit and cytoscape.js](https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/2019/03/20/draw-molecular-network-on-jupyter-notebook-with-rdkit-and-cytoscape-js-2-rdkit-cytoscape/) demonstrates.  
  
  
_I was also going to include some sections on querying and representing graphs, but this newsletter is already a little overlong, so that will have to wait till a later newsletter..._
