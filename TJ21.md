Welcome to this twenty-first edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ21), as it comes of age...  
  
Unfortunately, I had rather less than 21 hours to commit to putting this edition of the newsletter together _\[though at times it felt like more...!;-)—Ed.\]_, so it is what it is, and what it is all seems to be rather graphical/visual...

News
----

**Jupyter notebook** has been released at the [v6.0](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#release-6-0) level. _\[I note that requests to Jupyter Gateway(s) are now natively supported via an embedded notebook2kernelGateway (NB2KG), which might be interesting to educational providers who could perhaps run hosted kernels for bring-your-own-notebook-server students...? —Ed.\]_  
  
A few days earlier, **J****upyter client** (which contains the reference implementation of the Jupyter protocol, client and kernel management APIs for working with kernels, and the Jupyter kernelspec entrypoint for installing kernelspecs for use with Jupyter frontends) bumped up to [v5.3.0](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/releases/tag/5.3.0) ([announcement](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-client-5-3-0-release/1584)) with added support for multiprocessing and threading. The Python version train also seems to be chugging along, with support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 being dropped.

Some interesting looking experiments also appear to be underway around the **Jupyter Kernel Gateway** based on a new(?) [base kernel provider](https://github.com/gateway-experiments/remote_kernel_provider) package; for example, a [kubernetes kernel provider](https://github.com/gateway-experiments/kubernetes_kernel_provider) and a [yarn kernel provider](https://github.com/gateway-experiments/yarn_kernel_provider). _\[Without the need to install an nb2kg gateway extension into the latest notebooks, I wonder if we'll start to see more kernel gateways appearing so folk can connect to them from their own (local) notebook servers? —Ed.\]_

**[ScriptedForms](https://github.com/SimonBiggs/scriptedforms)**, which let you simple script interactive forms from a markdown document with inset code'n'ipywidgets, is now archived in deference to Voila _\[I'd personally like to thank Simon Biggs for originally developing that project; it helped me appreciate one useful direction in which Jupyter deployments could go... —Ed.\]_.  
  
The **Voila Gallery**, as teased in [#TJ19](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ19.md#news), had a formal announcement [post](http://https://blog.jupyter.org/a-gallery-of-voil%C3%A0-examples-a2ce7ef99130) on the official Jupyter blog. Built as a plugin for The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH), it looks easy enough to [deploy your own gallery](https://github.com/voila-gallery/gallery?#deploying-your-own-gallery), either pbli or private. _\[The deployment guide suggests cloning the original gallery plugin rep; that's another good candidate for a [template repo](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/), surely? —Ed.\]_  
  
Chris Holdgraf has posted a notebook generating various **[community activity reports](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/choldgraf/jupyter-activity-snapshot/blob/master/templates/jupyter-activity-template.ipynb)** over the Jupyter discourse forum and project Github repos _\[is this auto-updated with regularly scheduled CI? —Ed.\]_.  
  
Also on the Discourse forum, a fascinatingly instructive [post](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/what-happens-when-the-hub-restarts/1701) from @minrk on _What happens when the \[JupyterHub/BinderHub\] restarts? \[TLDR: user sessions should continue ok...—Ed.\]_ If you're tasked with running a **high availability** service, this is probably worth a read...  
  
Picking up on the _nb2xls_ **Excel** exporter mentioned in [#TJ20](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ20.md#news), another possible stepping stone from Excel to Jupyter based workflows is the [jupyterlab-spreadsheet](https://github.com/quigleyj97/jupyterlab-spreadsheet) file handler plugin that provides a simple spreadsheet viewer for XLS, XLSX and CSV files; its recent v0.1.0 release adds JupyterLab v1.0 support.  
  
Elsewhere in small-o office workflow land, the **[nb2mail](https://github.com/nfultz/nb2mail)**_nbconvert_ exporter and postprocessor that converts notebooks to multipart MIME messages then posts them via SMTP has moved up to v0.6.  
  
An old-school waiting list sign up marketing campaign from Paperspace _\[how I remember signing up for early invites... —Ed.\]_ for their "free **GPU** plan". Light on details, but everyone already has your email _\[I know I do...—Ed.\]_ so why not one more?! Sign up [here](https://gradient.paperspace.com/free-gpu?utm_source=tracking-jupyter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=free-gpu-notebook-waitlist-launch). _\[I normally strip tracking campaign tags from links, but thought I'd experiment with co-opting that one in case they give me some free invites to share, which used to be another old trick...—Ed.\]_ By the by, other free-for-developers GPU providers are available, such as [Spell](https://spell.run/pricing), for whatever definition of free they're using...  
  
If **R**'s your thing, there's now a template [course-starter-r](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r) repo for writing courses using Ines Montani's Binder backed interactive course format. If you have an R based DataCamp course repo to hand, there's also a contributed [recipe](https://github.com/laderast/decampr) for converting DataCamp repos that course format.  
  
One for the **Java** hackers... [dflib](https://github.com/nhl/dflib) (_DataFrame Library_) is _"a lightweight pure Java implementation of a common DataFrame data structure" for use in-memory and over dynamically defined data structures"_. The [source](https://twitter.com/andrus_a/status/1151467849506070529) I picked it up from claims it's _"\[s\]till pretty new and lots of fun to develop and use (e.g. doing data analysis with Jupyter)"_ _\[fun? Java? —Ed.\]_ but I couldn't offhand see how to get a Jupyter demo working _\[using a Beakerx Java/JVM kernel ([#TJ4](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ4.md#interfacing-with-data-stores), [#TJ8](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ8.md#polyglot-notebooks-and-kernels)) maybe? —Ed.\]_.  
  
And finally, Frédéric Collonval contributed a link to a [fork](https://github.com/fcollonval/jupyter_conda) of the (stalled?) **nb\_conda** package mentioned in #TJ19 which update the package and now provides support for JupyterLab. Michał Krassowski also tipped me off to the fact that the **[jupyterlab\_spellchecker](https://github.com/ijmbarr/jupyterlab_spellchecker)** and **[jupyterlab-go-to-definition](https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-go-to-definition)** (go to a variable definition) extensions now work "in the editor and for newly created cells" in JupyterLab 1.0 _\[thanks, folks.. —Ed\]_.  
 

From the Twitterz...
--------------------

A PhD student [observes](https://twitter.com/wcrichton/status/1150622488994279424): _"I feel like data science is underappreciated as a pathway into programming. Numpy/Pandas embody the LOGO ethos: 1) DSLs where operations map to existing vocab (i.e. high school statistics), 2) highly visible program state (Jupyter + dataframes)"_...  
  
...whilst a discrete geometer [channels](https://twitter.com/ProfJohnBowers/status/1149842248718327808) his inner commando: _"\[p\]rogramming in python is like showing up to a fight with your dominant hand tied behind your back. And numpy/scipy/jupyter is like being handed a bazooka. It sucks that your hand is tied behind your back, but it ultimately doesn't matter in the fight"_. _\[If you didn't get the reference, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNEiBl3aQcY)! —Ed.\]_  
  
A craft beer lover [notes](https://twitter.com/EricSchillerDev/status/1147256000761802757): _"\[n\]eeding any specific laptop to learn coding is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Between online workspaces like Glitch or Codepen, light workspaces like Jupyter, and virtual environments like Docker, hardware doesn’t matter"_...  
  
...a CS professor [caveats](https://twitter.com/lindsey/status/1147399198326657024): _"I could be wrong, but to me it really seems like a good thing to teach beginners with in 2019 is hosted Jupyter notebooks. Once people have some wins that way, later on they can move to local notebooks and later still to setting up fancier local dev environments"_...  
  
...and a fruity tech writer [laments](https://twitter.com/iwasleeg/status/1147083315360489472): _"I feel like nobody is talking about the fact that when you make a presentation from a Jupyter notebook, the <body> starts on line 13236 of the HTML document and 55kb of external CSS is fetched"_. _\[I have to admit, I didn't check... erm... —Ed.\]_  
  
Meanwhile, a sociologist quietly [admits](https://twitter.com/george_berry/status/1147278249917112320):_ "My version control is the Jupyter Notebook "Make a copy..." button don't @ me"..._  
  
...as a VP Research [reflects](https://twitter.com/deliprao/status/1150923697588277248): _"\[e\]ngineers can easily pick up machine learning, esp. with a lot of effort to make it accessible without years of graduate school training. To make engineering concepts/tools easily accessible for researchers without them having to spend a lot of time is something missing today"_. _\[Templates might help too... —Ed.\]_  
  
And finally, a science and sustainable energy enthusiast [enthuses](https://twitter.com/TheosLiveLife/status/1150830518197469186): _"\[w\]__e have obtained a teach grant! Read about how we will spend this money to develop new teaching materials using Jupyter Notebooks for the 21st century class room__"_. You can find out how they'll use it [here](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/theochri/2019/07/11/we-have-a-teaching-grant/).

Another Plotting Miscellany
---------------------------

Following on from the round-up of various plotting tools in [TJ19](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ19.md#a-plotting-miscellany), here are yet more...  
  
For exploratory data analysis,[jupyter-vcdat](https://github.com/CDAT/jupyter-vcdat) provides a JupyterLab extension to [CDAT](https://cdat.llnl.gov/) (Community Data Analysis Tools), _"a powerful and complete front-end to a rich set of visual-data exploration and analysis capabilities well suited for data analysis problems"_ developed at LLNL (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) _"for the analysis, visualization, and management of large-scale distributed climate data"_.  
  
CDAT itself builds on [VTK](https://vtk.org/), the Visualization Toolkit ([#TJ18](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ18.md#imaging-the-first)), an open source software library for manipulating and displaying scientific data. VTK support is also offered by several other packages, such as [vtki](http://docs.vtki.org/index.html) (_"__a Pythonic, well-documented interface exposing VTK’s powerful visualization backend to facilitate rapid prototyping, analysis, and visual integration of spatially referenced datasets"_ \[[examples](http://docs.vtki.org/examples/index.html)\]) and [pyvista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista).   
  
Indeed, PyVista looks like it could be one to watch more closely. Citeable as_ PyVista: 3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), Journal of Open Source Software, 4(37), 1450, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01450_, it supports _"3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK)"_. There a set of example notebooks [here](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista-examples).  
  
By adding native Jupyter notebook support to toolkits like _pyvista_, we can get accelerating returns in terms of the number of other downstream packages that in turn support notebook integration. For example, [this commit](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/commit/a2c75903d4471587582bc2715985dc82eff9ac12) to the [mne-tools/mne-python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) package, (MNE : Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) in Python, an _"open-source Python package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data such as MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG"_ adds notebook detection and _pyvista_ notebook support to that package in a couple of lines. _\[More generally, it's quite likely that in maintained packages, updates may increasingly provide added notebook support "for free" via new or improved \_repr\_X\_ support as and when it's added to package objects...—Ed.\]_  
  
Another really interesting looking charting project that has yet to make a formally introduced appearance in _Tracking Jupyter_ is [HoloViz](http://holoviz.org/index.html), _"a coordinated effort to \[support\] browser-based data visualization in Python"_ that seems to provide a common framework across multiple different tools _\[I think I need to review separate HoloViz family members in turn in future editions... —Ed.\]__. HoloViz_ builds on wide range of other projects (static and interactive charting packages from _matplotlib_ to _plotly_, data manipulation packages such as _pandas_ and _dask_, best of breed geo and graph/network packages, and so on...) to provide what looks like a single "metapackage" entrypoint to a wider range of charting tools that can between them cover a wide range of visualisation needs in a best of breed way. _\[From its README, the [lantern](https://github.com/timkpaine/lantern) package looks like it might also provide a single point of entry to multiple charting packages..? —Ed.\]_

Jupyter Plumbing and Wiring
---------------------------

_\[At this point I get even more out of my depth, but even if the tech details escape me, I think it's good to know architecturally that things like this exist...—Ed.\]_  
  
The _ipywidgets_ **widget model** [low level protocol](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Low%20Level.html)defines the comms channel that keeps state in sync between a WidgetModel in the front-end and a Widget instance in the kernel, withboth models having the same precedence. For example, the _ipyleaflet_ Jupyter widget [allows you](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/issues/290#issuecomment-463263793) to access the _geojson_ string for a shape drawn interactively on a rendered map using the _ipyleaflet_ DrawControl. This ability to pass state between Javascript widget models rendered in the notebook and Python state in the kernel is a fertile ground for developing interactive controls that appear to act directly on back-end state.  
  
_Just in, I note that a video of the SciPy 2019 Jupyter Interactive Widget Ecosystem tutorial is [now available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaSpqsKaRbo), which I must add to my to-watch list..._  
  
Another comms loop is passing data from a widget back into another notebook cell. For example, the [jupyterlab-outsource](https://github.com/deathbeds/jupyterlab-outsource) repo demonstrates an embedded Blockly style editor that renders equivalent Python code in a neighbouring JupyterLab notebook cell as you create the Blockly programme (the reverse path — code edits to the Python reflected in the Blockly program — is _not_ supported).  
  
Whilst on a Blockly riff, I also note this [_old_](https://github.com/PhE/jupyterlab_blockly) JupyterLab extension for viewing Blockly files and this [Metakernel Jigsaw magic](https://github.com/Calysto/metakernel/blob/master/metakernel/magics/jigsaw_magic.py) for working with a Blockly editor inline in a notebook _\[I did a brief review of the Jisgaw magic [here](https://blog.ouseful.info/2017/12/09/scratch-materials/)...—Ed.\]_. Fans of Python in Blockly style environments might also note that changes appear to be afoot over at [BlockPy](https://github.com/RealTimeWeb/blockpy/) that might bring elements of that environment into the Jupyterverse.  
  
A complementary approach to the _ipywidgets_ bi-directional comms _\[I think? —Ed.\]_ is provided by the [altair-transform](https://github.com/jakevdp/altair-transform) package. **[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html)**, the declarative visualization in Python package, renders charts using Vega-Lite. The Vega-Lite grammar allows transforms to be applied to data "chart-side" which can make it difficult to access those values from a kernel that passed data _into_ the chart widget where it was transformed. The _altair-transform_ package _"includes a (nearly) complete Python implementation of Vega-Lite's transform layer"_ so I'm guessing what this package does is to to replay transformation steps from the chart grammar on the kernel side to let you _"easily extract a pandas dataframe with the computed values shown in the chart"_ rather than grab those values from the chart defined as an _ipywidget_ with shared state widget and kernel side? _\[If you think I've got that wrong, which is quite possible, please let me know... I was just trying to interpret the words in the README! —Ed.\]_  
  
On the other hand, [pyviz\_comms](https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz_comms) _does_ seem to offer a simple bidirectional communication architecture for **PyViz** tools and the HoloViz ecosystem _"__in both the classic notebook and Jupyterlab"_. _\[It would be nice to see some diagrams and examples showing what sorts of comms are supported... I don't have much of a feel for what this does compared to the ipywidgets low level comms, for example?—Ed.\]_  
  
**_[ipyevents](https://github.com/mwcraig/ipyevents)_ **seems to effectively extend the _ipywidgets_ model further in the form of a custom widget for returning mouse and keyboard events to Python. Suggested use cases include adding keyboard shortcuts to existing widgets and installing callbacks on arbitrary mouse and keyboard events in new widgets. The binderised example notebook includes a demo that allows you to click on the output from a run cell to return the notebook selection focus to that cell _\[although I didn't have much success running some of the other demos... —Ed.\]_.  
  
Creating user interfaces from the Python side, [idom](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom) is _"a tool for controlling the **DOM** with python"_ that provides _"libraries for defining, \[serving\] and controlling interactive webpages with Python 3.6+"_. A Binderised demo includes an example of _"creat\[ing\] a simple slideshow which changes whenever a user clicks an image"_.  
  
On the **kernel development** side, a [post](https://blog.jupyter.org/building-a-calculator-jupyter-kernel-4aed5764a295) recently appeared on the official Jupyter blog on _Building a Calculator Jupyter Kernel_ that provides _"a step-by-step guide for authoring language kernels with Xeus"_. So if you fancy polishing your reverse Polish, and then wrapping it with a simple Jupyter kernel protocol handler, this could be something to do over the weekend...  
  
Complementing that, a [post-mortem](https://gist.github.com/brainysmurf/bf34b004ad13e48f2dca292ce7957014) on writing a custom pseudo-code kernel for Jupyter using Metakernel. The kernel itself seems to be [here](https://github.com/classroomtechtools/ibdpcs_pseudocode_learningtools), but it's late in the day newsletter production-wise and I didn't fancy trying to follow the installation notes \[what? No Binder? —Ed.\] so I've no idea what it's actually like to use...  
  
And finally, if you care deeply about logging and **Jupyter telemetry** primarily on the server side _\[although all this widget-kernel bidirectional comms suggest that user-side logging may also become a possibility? —Ed.\]_, and maybe GDPR issues associated with the same, now might be a good time to pass your eye over the [Jupyter Telemetry Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/41) (and the associated [draft press release](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/41/files/84fdaa726ed22301861468ae21c0bfe22f24671b#diff-5c74b6c64dfb44b841261c64623c9c6e)) that builds on the [JupyterLab telemetry extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/4)team compass item. There's also a draft design doc [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-telemetry/blob/master/design.md). _\[I did umm and ahh about posting links to draft project items currently under discussion, but transparency is part of the Jupyter project ethos, and to my mind that includes trying to engage folk who might have something to contribute; the Tracking Jupyter newsletter subscription list still identifies readers as a pretty niche and select audience, after all! ;-) —Ed.\]_  
 

Drawing On Notebooks
--------------------

Being able to annotate, or scrawl over, a notebook is now supported in various ways, which can be handy when using a notebook in a live presentation setting.  
  
I'm not quite sure when this feature appeared, but the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) _reveal.js_ presentation extension now allows you to scribble over a slide mid-presentation, [chalkboard style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx2TnIdt0hw&t=28m30s). In passing, I also note that RISE now also supports speaker notes. _\[I also wondered about export formats; it [seems](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/exportpdf.html) you can use nbconvert, add ?print-pdf to the end of the presentation URL, or use [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) automation to generate a PDF export of a RISE slideshow. —Ed.\]_  
  
For recorded annotations delivered via interactive screencasts, I think [JupyterGraffiti](https://github.com/willkessler/jupytergraffiti) ([#TJ16](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ16.md#educationally-relevant)) probably still leads the way. _\[Thinks: graffiti is to screencasts what RISE is to presentations... —Ed.\]_  
  
For drawing over items within a notebook outside of a RISE presentation setting, [pizarra\_nb](https://github.com/kikocorreoso/pizarra-nb) is a new extension _\[still early days? —Ed.\]_ that creates a canvas from a cell and allows you to interactively draw over it. _\[The size of the grabbed cell (without zooming out) was a bit off for me when I tried it... —Ed.\]_ Once annotated, you can save the view as a PNG and/or drop the image into the cell below.  
 

It's All Gone a Bit 3D
----------------------

Following on from the plotting miscellany in [#TJ19](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ19.md#a-plotting-miscellany) plotting, and some example of 3D visualisation tools in [#TJ6](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ6.md#jupyter-goes-3d), here are some more 3D tools, including examples of plotting meshes and 3D models with a CAD twist.  
  
[Mayavi](https://github.com/enthought/mayavi) is _"a general purpose, cross-platform tool for 2-D and 3-D scientific data visualization"_. Originally developed for use with Qt, three separate backends provide [Mayavi support in Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/tips.html#using-mayavi-in-jupyter-notebooks): a _png_ backend, an _X3D_ backend for creating interactive 3D scenes, or a fully interactive _ipy_ backend that uses _ipywidgets_ and _ipyevents_ to provide a rich Mayavi UI window with full support for Mayavi visualizations using VTK. _\[The repo isn't Binderised, but installing the package (and ensuring ipyevents was also installed), enabling the Mayavi extension and running a quick demo seemed to work, with the X3D backend if nothing else. —Ed.\]_  
  
Given a 3D mesh, plotly has a [3d-mesh](https://plot.ly/python/3d-mesh/) tool for plotting a 3D set of triangles from vertices given by x, y and z co-ordinates, with Delaunay triangulation used to draw the triangles (triangle co-ordinates can also be supplied via i, j and k parameters).  
  
[PyGEL](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/projects/GEL/PyGEL/) is a Python library for geometry processing, providing Python bindings for _"a subset of the C++ based [GEL](https://github.com/janba/GEL) library"_ via the pip installable [PyGEL3D](https://pypi.org/project/PyGEL3D/) package. 3D rendering is handled in notebooks using the plotly. _\[I couldn't find the notebook as a notebook, so I converted the nbconvert-ed HTML of the notebook back to ipynb using code from [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47138762/454773). Methinks that that (sic) code could provide the basis of a a nice little service, and/or Jupytext filter... As for a mesh, I found a bunny file in the GEL repo... —Ed.\]_  
  
If you fancy raytracing, the [pyRT](https://github.com/martinchristen/pyRT) (_"The Python Raytracer"_) seems to play nicely with Jupyter notebooks. _\[The repo isn't Binderised, but the Jupyter demos I tried seem to run if you pip install numpy and Pillow... —Ed.\]_  
  
Another ray tracer, UCL Geography's _Librat_ Monte Carlo Ray Tracer _\[free "for non-commercial use"...—Ed.\]_  
[looks like](https://github.com/philwilkes/librat_in_jupyter_python3) it should also work with notebooks but getting everything installed looked like it could be too much of a time suck for me even if it did go smoothly... _\[If anyone manages to Binderise this and get a demo running, please let me know...—Ed.\]_  
  
If it's **3D CAD** drawings you're looking to render, extension to render _CadQuery_ objects, [jupyter-cadquery](https://github.com/bernhard-42/jupyter-cadquery) claims to display them for you in JupyterLab using _pythreejs_ (the extension also requires PythonOCC ([#TJ3](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/blob/master/TJ3.md#notebooks-in-research))). _\[[CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models, apparently...—Ed.\]_ Trying a Binder build failed for me and I didn't have time to check why, so I'm not sure how it plays... I'm guessing a second repo, "out-of-date" repo, [cadquery-jupyter-extension](https://github.com/bernhard-42/cadquery-jupyter-extension), implemented an earlier notebook extension, but that is just a guess... _\[That repo did build on MyBinder, but it was missing dependencies when I tried to run the demo notebooks and I didn't have a chance to fork it and try to fix it...—Ed.\]_  
  
[ViewSCAD](https://github.com/nickc92/ViewSCAD) is a Jupyter renderer for the [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) and [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) Constructive Solid Geometry languages. Again, there are dependencies for this one (_openscad_) and I didn't get a chance to fork and Binderise this repo, either, to try it out. _\[My bad, again... But each build takes time to figure out... Maybe I should have held this over to the next issue, or the one after that..:-( —Ed.\]_
