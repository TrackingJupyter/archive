Tracking Jupyter Newsletter, the Tenth...
=========================================

by Tony Hirst

Welcome to this tenth edition of the _Tracking Jupyter_ newsletter (#TJ10) and the first of 2019.  
  
To make searching the Tracking Jupyter archive easier, I'll be popping [archived copies of the TrackingJupyter newsletter on Github](https://github.com/TrackingJupyter/archive/tree/master). The archived items are created from the [newsletter archive](https://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter/archive) version using the [Turndown](https://domchristie.github.io/turndown/) HTML-to-markdown converter.  
  
Things were a getting a little bit unsustainable last year, so this year each newsletter may end up being shorter _\[erm, I already seem to have gone over the 1500 word limit I set myself... —Ed.\]_ and/or moving to once a fortnight, rather than weekly_._ Finding news items also takes time, so if you have some Jupyter news to share, please post it to the [Jupyter _discourse_ site](https://discourse.jupyter.org/), which I check regularly, or mail me directly...  
 

News
----

A new Python kernel for Jupyter is out, [xeus-python](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-python), based on the _xeus_ C++ implementation of the Jupyter kernel protocol \[[announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/a-new-python-kernel-for-jupyter-fcdf211e30a8)\]. It supports _"error formatting, rich display, interactive widgets, input requests, code completion, code inspection, etc."_ and comes in lighter than the default IPython kernel.  
  
The Jupyter Community Workshops 2019, calls for which were announced late last year, [have been announced](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshops-a7f1dca1735e). Six of the seventeen applications have been funded, with topics covering Python Coding for Kids, Parents and Teachers in Cornwall _\[Yeah! Go team South-West:-) —Ed.\]_; _nbgrader_ development _\[does that that mean Noteable users won't have to pay extra for nbgrader integration?!;-) —Ed.\]_; dashboarding; server design and roadmap; scientific user facilities / high performance computing (HPC); and kernel protocol development and support._ \[Congratulations to all the recipients. —Ed.\]_  
  
If you need academic citations to bolster any case you have to make, a brief overview article of nbgrader, by those responsible for it, has just been published in _The Journal of Open Source Education_: [nbgrader: A Tool for Creating and Grading Assignments in the Jupyter Notebook](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00032).  
  
Jupyter Enterprise Gateway, a _"web server (built directly on Jupyter Kernel Gateway) that enables the ability to launch kernels on behalf of remote notebooks throughout your enterprise compute cluster"_, has been released at [version 2.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1). It includes official [support for Kubernetes](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-kubernetes.html), with the gateway _"provisioned as a Kubernetes deployment and exposed as a Kubernetes service"_. The release also provides [Jupyterhub integration](https://blog.jupyter.org/on-demand-notebooks-with-jupyterhub-jupyter-enterprise-gateway-and-kubernetes-e8e423695cbf).  
  
You can now publish notebooks directly to [RStudio Connect](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/01/17/announcing-rstudio-connect-1-7-0/), the interactive publishing platform hosted by _RStudio_, using the [rsconnect-jupyter](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsconnect-jupyter/) plugin. Guidance for installing in a Jupyterhub context is also provided.  
  
Via the twitterz, a nifty cartoon promoting Binder has been doing the rounds recently, although I think it dates from much earlier... Produced by Juliette Belin, licensed under Creative Commons _\[though I'm not sure /exactly/ how... —Ed.\],_ for the opendreamkit.org EU project, it can be seen in context in the post [Publishing Reproducible Logbooks](https://opendreamkit.org/2017/11/02/use-case-publishing-reproducible-notebooks/); several other [Binder use cases](https://opendreamkit.org/2018/03/15/jupyterhub-binder-convergence/) are described in a separate project document.  
  
Segueing neatly from that, Jupyter discourse community members _@sgibson91_ and _@KirstieJane_ are looking for helpers (travel expenses covered) to help out at Binderhub workshops in the UK in February and March, 2019. These will cover Binderising repos (for a general researcher audience) as well as running local Binderhub services _\[Sigh... I keep dreaming of an OU hosted Binderhub.. —Ed.\]_. Get in touch via the [Jupyter community site](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/binder-binderhub-workshops-help-wanted/313) if you think you might be able to help...

Keeping Track...
----------------

...of what version everything is running at can be problematic at times. For sure, including environment defining files so your repo runs on MyBinder is a start, but sometimes, for sharing just the notebooks themselves, it can make sense to provide metadata in some form about just what's required to run the code.  
  
The [watermark IPython extension](https://github.com/rasbt/watermark) looks quite handy in this regard. It'll print out _"date and time stamps, \[Python package\] version numbers, and hardware information"_. I don't think it'll list dependent Linux packages though?  
  
On the other hand, if you've got as far as separating your code out of notebook and into a separate python module file, but you still need to make changes the python module, the [_%autoreload_ IPython magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html#autoreload) will reloads modules automatically before executing functions imported from those modules. _This is an oldie, but a goodie, which I was reminded of via this catchily entitled post: [Write less terrible code with Jupyter Notebook](https://blog.godatadriven.com/write-less-terrible-notebook-code)._  
 

Editors Otherwise...
--------------------

Although many of us live in Jupyter notebooks, for some, it's not the ideal environment. So how about some old school flavoured editor alternatives? The [EIN -- Emacs IPython Notebook](https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook)_"lets you edit and run Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks within Emacs"_. On the other hand, this [jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding), _"enable\[s a\] Vim like environment powered by CodeMirror's Vim"_.  
  
If you picked up on Jupytext \[[#TJ6](https://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter/letters/tracking-jupyter-newsletter-the-sixth)\], the text format with notebook duals, [jupytext.vim](https://github.com/goerz/jupytext.vim) is a Vim/Neovim plugin _"for editing Jupyter notebook (ipynb) files through jupytext"_. According to the repo, _"when you open a Jupyter Notebook (\*.ipynb) file, it is automatically converted from json to markdown or python through the jupytext utility, and the result is loaded into the buffer. Upon saving, the ipynb file is updated with any modifications."_  
 

Publishing Notebooks
--------------------

Arguably, Jupyter publishing workflows still fall short of R's when it comes to generating pretty, publishable content, but there are a growing number of converters.  
  
For Jekyll based publishing, [nbjekyll](https://github.com/trallard/nbjekyll) will _"__convert Jupyter notebooks to .md files that \[can\] be immediately passed into Jekyll"._  
  
The core  [jupyter-book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book) project also renders notebooks using Jekyll, with the added bonus that [interactivity is supported](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/_build/features/interact.md) with the automatic addition of links toBinder or JupyterHub or ThebeLab call outs. _(I also note that nbinteract support seems to have dropped out of the current version of jupyter-book, though via [this issue](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/issues/82) it looks as if it may be on the way back...)_  
  
For the enterprise developers, [nbconflux](https://github.com/Valassis-Digital-Media/nbconflux) _"converts Jupyter Notebooks to Atlassian Confluence pages using nbconvert"_. Apparently, it will _"convert most cell inputs and outputs to valid __[Confluence storage format](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html), a__ttach image outputs (e.g., matplotlib PNGs) to a page, show them inline, and maintain the page-image association in the version history"_.  
 

Notebook Style Guides
---------------------

If you're into the New Year resolution thing, maybe its time you adopted a style guide for your notebooks? _In the OU, we have __have "Unit 0" style guides that set out how course materials are structured, as well as demonstrating their look and feel. Whilst we try to keep notebooks within any given course a similar sort of structure, this is still done informally. (Managing the notebook extension context, and exploiting extension functionality within notebooks — for example, by using folding headers, code folding, exercise structures — is also handled informally.)_  
  
One thing that's easily done is prettifying code. For example, the[code\_prettify](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/code_prettify)_nbextension_ will style code in code cells. _(I also used that extension for __[Styling Python and SQL Code in Jupyter Notebooks](https://blog.ouseful.info/2018/10/01/styling-python-and-sql-code-in-jupyter-notebooks/).)_  
  
In terms of emerging best practice, this article on [Building a Repeatable Data Analysis Process with Jupyter Notebooks](http://pbpython.com/notebook-process.html) provides a simple business use-case starting point, with observations on directory structures/file naming conventions, notebook structure (including things like use context, data sources, and a change log).  
  
[Coding Standards for Jupyter Notebook](https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcuser/coding-standards-for-jupyter-notebook/), by the lead product engineer for ArcGIS API for Python at Esri, also provides some useful rules of thumb: _"use headings and markdown lavishly; use LaTeX for equations; break longer segments of code into multiple cells; plot profusely; coding standards for your python snippets; all imports at the top of the notebook; be explicit about uncommon libraries"_.  
  
If you're working in a JupyterLab environment, the [jupyterlab\_templates](https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab_templates) extension might also be handy...  
  
Also at a practical level, this post on [Making Publication Ready Notebooks](http://blog.juliusschulz.de/blog/ultimate-ipython-notebook) suggests a range of tips for customising your notebook environment (for example, using the _code-folding_, _python-markdown_ and _cite2c extensions_), creating snippets, using markdown and LaTeX, and managing citations and figure metadata.  
  
A style guide is one thing, of course, but there's also the issue of reproducibility when it comes to academic publications. If you fancy a quick debate on this with colleagues over a coffee, this post on the [Reproducibility Debate: Should Code Release be Compulsory for Conference Publications?](https://anima-ai.org/2019/01/04/reproducibility-debate-should-code-release-be-compulsory-for-conference-publications/) has some opening claims for each side of the motion.  
  
_Traditional news outlets typically have style guides for their published content, so I wonder: are there any organisational style guides for notebooks out there yet, particularly in a data journalism context? The Financial Times' [FT Visual Vocabulary](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/tree/master/visual-vocabulary) sets out their visual style for charts, but do they have a style for notebooks too? _  
 

Example Notebooks
-----------------

One of the great things about Jupyter notebooks is that it makes it easy to share small demonstrations that others can try out using MyBinder and then perhaps use as part of other or bigger things.  
  
So here are a couple of examples with a digital humanities theme...  
  
This [Election Map Tutorial](https://github.com/hodgesmr/election_map_tutorial/blob/master/Election_Map_Tutorial.ipynb) demonstrates how to _"use structured election results from OpenElections to visualize and map election data"_. Unfortunately, it currently seems to be hitting an issue, in part, _\[[this one?](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj/issues/134) —Ed.\]_ when running in MyBinder. Click through the errors and the rest of it runs okay, though...  
  
And this [ArchiveTeam Ingest Rate](https://github.com/edsu/notebooks/blob/master/ArchiveTeam.ipynb) notebook shows how to _"chart the growth of the ArchiveTeam collection at the Internet Archive \[using\] the Internet Archive's Scrape API"_.  
  
So if you've done a little thing you'd like to show and tell, pop a notebook onto Github, check it runs in [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) \[[docs](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\], and share it with a #jupyter tagged link on Twitter...
